      "content": "This systematic review evaluates the role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in managing functional head and neck paragangliomas (FPG), which pose unique challenges due to catecholamine secretion and associated functional symptoms. Currently there are no established management guidelines for FPG because of their rarity. We explore clinical, radiological and hormonal outcomes of SRS and conventional radiotherapy (RT), challenging traditional assumptions of radioresistance in FPG. Following PRISMA guidelines, databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, and Embase were searched for English-language studies on SRS for head and neck paragangliomas (HNPG) up to December 2024. Keywords included \"Glomus,\" \"SRS,\" \"Gamma Knife Radiosurgery,\" and \"CyberKnife.\" Studies reporting clinical, radiological, or hormonal outcomes for FPG treated with SRS were included. Data extraction focused on tumor location, SRS parameters, clinical symptoms, and follow-up results. We included eight studies, documenting 10 cases of FPG treated with SRS. Tumors were located in the jugular (6 cases), Jugulo-tympanic (3 cases), and carotid body (1 case). Seven cases were treated with Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS), while CyberKnife was used in three. Primary SRS was performed in three cases, and five underwent secondary SRS for residual or recurrent disease. Hormonal outcomes showed normalization of catecholamine levels in six cases 30-36 months post-SRS. There was resolution of functional symptoms in all cases treated with high-dose SRS. SRS is a viable alternative or adjunct to surgical intervention in FPG, achieving favorable clinical, hormonal, and radiological outcomes with minimal morbidity. Our findings challenge the conventional view of the radioresistance of FPG, highlighting the potential for sustained biochemical and symptomatic control.",

      "content": "The composite was characterized using FTIR, XRD, FESEM, TGA, and BET techniques. The effects of the temperature, adsorption period, and pH on Au(III) adsorption were investigated. The optimal conditions to achieve the maximum adsorption of Au(III) on the adsorbent surface were pH 6.0, 50◦C, 40 min, and 10 mg of adsorbent. Moreover, oxidized magnetic corncobs functionalized with thiol (OCBs@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@UiO-66-SH) showed a notable ability to adsorb Au(III), with a capacity of 1587 mg/g. With the mass ratios of Au(III) to competing ions (Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co, Cd, and Ni) fixed at 1:1 or extended to 1:5, this adsorbent prefers Au(III) ions while showing negligible adsorption to other ions. This study validated a technique to extract Au (III) from various electronic waste samples, achieving high recoveries (95.30% to 104.75%), demonstrating its effectiveness and lack of matrix interference. Examining various isotherm and kinetic models demonstrated that the Langmuir and pseudo-first-order models could effectively interpret the experimental and kinetic data. Thermodynamic calculations showed that the adsorption process is endothermic and occurs spontaneously. The optimal utilization of renewable waste as an adsorbent base, high adsorption capacity, recoverability, and reusability owing to its magnetic properties, high recovery rate of Au(III) from electronic matrices, and highly selective adsorption in the presence of competing ions are among the advantages of this adsorbent. Together, these features highlight the novelty of the present study.",

      "content": "The perioperative transfusion strategies in this setting is under debate. Evidence specific to spinal metastasis surgery remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of liberal versus restrictive transfusion strategy on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for spinal metastasis. A retrospective study was conducted with patients who underwent surgery for spinal metastasis. Using propensity score matching (PSM), patients were matched into restrictive and liberal transfusion groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Postoperative outcomes, including 30-day complications, hospital stay, and survival rates at 3 months and 1 year, were compared between the groups. Among 483 patients, 303 received at least one unit of red blood cells during hospitalization. Of these, 125 (41.3%) were in the restrictive transfusion group, and 178 (58.7%) in the liberal transfusion group. After PSM, 70 patients in each group were matched 1:1, ensuring comparable baseline characteristics. Post-matching analysis revealed no significant differences between the groups in key outcomes: 3-month survival (84% vs. 83%, P = 0.820), 1-year survival (46% vs. 51%, P = 0.499), 30-day postoperative complications (19% vs. 23%, P = 0.532), and median length of stay (15 [IQR, 11-18] days vs. 13 [IQR, 11-17] days, P = 0.316). Our study supports using a restrictive transfusion strategy with a target nadir Hb level of 7-8 g/dL for spinal metastasis surgery. This approach ensures adequate oxygen delivery while minimizing unnecessary transfusions and associated risks. Future studies should validate these findings and further explore patient-centered outcomes to refine transfusion strategy in high-risk oncology patients. Not applicable.",

      "content": "Data were obtained from the TB Information Management System, with case counts and notification rates calculated by gender, age, and year. TB notification rates and trends were analyzed under two demographic scenarios: a constant aging scenario and an increasing aging scenario. Grey models (GM (1,1)) and age-period-cohort (APC) models were employed to forecast changes in the elderly population as well as age-specific TB notification rates. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) quantified trends over time. From 2015 to 2023, a total of 29,694 TB cases were reported, with males accounting for 69.79%. In 2023, the notification rate was 19.55 per 100,000, with the highest rate observed among individuals aged 65 years and older, reaching 48.47 per 100,000. The proportion of older adults among TB patients increased annually. Predictions indicated a peak notification rate among those aged 70-79 over the next five years. Compared to the constant aging scenario, the increasing aging scenario was associated with a more moderate reduction in TB notification rates (34.49% vs. 42.81%) and a slower declining trend over the study period (EAPC = -3.50, 95% CI: -4.70 to -2.29 vs. EAPC = -4.45, 95% CI: -5.47 to -3.42). Population aging poses challenges to TB control, highlighting the need for targeted strategies for older adults.",

Upon the rupture of RFs, migrasomes can either be engulfed by surrounding cells or undergo lysis to release their contents into the extracellular microenvironment. The process through which cells release their contents via migrasomes is termed migracytosis. Migrasomes play crucial roles in intercellular signaling, cellular homeostasis maintenance, and intercellular material transport. This article provides a comprehensive review of the discovery, biogenesis, isolation and characterization, biological functions of migrasomes, as well as their roles in the occurrence, progression, diagnosis, and treatment of clinical diseases. Furthermore, this paper proposes novel hypotheses and future directions regarding the current research challenges of migrasomes and their potential clinical applications, which may facilitate future clinical diagnosis and treatment involving migrasomes.",

MT can inhibit this catalytic process, leading to partial recovery of the fluorescence of Ru-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and the decrease in UV-vis signal of the reaction system, as well as the gradual fading of the yellow color of the reaction solution. Hence, this triple-mode sensor can realize precise, reliable, and high-throughput determination of MT with correlative detection limits of 0.32, 0.46, and 0.67 μM. Moreover, this triple-mode sensor has been applied to MT detection in multiple juice samples with recoveries ranging from 86.00 to 99.68%, which indicates the suitability of the novel idea for the research and development of multimode optical sensors for food analysis.",

Consequently, many employees experiencing elevated levels of psychological stress have reported disengagement and dissatisfaction across various aspects of their work. Given the strong association between individual well-being and job satisfaction, how healthcare employees regulate their emotions and psychological health to attain job satisfaction remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, the present study investigates the effects of mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and employee well-being on healthcare workers' emotional and mental health while considering the mediating role of employee satisfaction and the moderating role of digital leadership.",

The study was conducted over 1 year (December 2023 to November 2024) and included patients diagnosed with NIU, scleritis, or episcleritis who failed primary IMT. The primary IMT and subsequent revisions were analyzed to identify patterns in the use of different IMT regimens and their effectiveness. The study cohort consisted of 54 patients. Panuveitis was found to be the most common anatomical diagnosis (44.4%). The primary IMT used was predominantly methotrexate (MTx) (83.3%). The first revision of IMT often involved combination therapy, with MTx + mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) being the most common combination (24.1%). Subsequent revisions also favored combination therapy, with increasing use of biologics like Adalimumab (ADA) and tofacitinib (Tofa). Subgroup analysis revealed Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH), being the most common etiologically diagnosed uveitic entity with primary IMT failure and increased use of Tofa in subsequent revisions of IMT. The study highlights the challenges in managing refractory uveitis. Combination therapy, particularly with MMF and MTx, is commonly advocated. The use of biologics like Tofa, especially in VKH, can be a valuable treatment option. Future prospective studies with larger cohorts are needed to validate these findings and explore the disease-specific effectiveness of IMT regimens.",

The study included 35 eyes with CSC and 35 control eyes. In CSC group, 82.86% were simple and 17.14% were complex. There was no statistically significant difference in the scleral thickness in CSC and control groups. Though the sclera was thicker in the complex CSC group compared to simple CSC at 3 mm (nasal: 724.33 ± 180.53 vs 658.48 ± 57.63, temporal: 696.17 ± 212.91 vs 628.83 ± 107.7) and 4 mm (nasal: 656.67 ± 109.34 vs 621.62 ± 79.31, temporal: 640.17 ± 191.31 vs 616.48 ± 86.30), the difference was not statistically significant. A moderate negative correlation was noted between SFCT and scleral thickness at 8 mm (r -0.349) and 3 mm on the nasal side (r -0.388) in the control group. A moderate negative correlation was noted between SFCT and scleral thickness at 4 mm (r -0.377) and 3 mm (r -0.403) on the temporal side in CSC group. The anterior scleral thickness was similar in CSC and healthy eyes. As the study sample predominantly included simple CSC, the findings indicate that the anterior scleral thickness may not be involved in the pathogenesis of simple CSC.",

      "content": "However, a certain subset of NIU patients does not respond to conventional IMT therapy, such as methotrexate and azathioprine. In these patients, biological IMT with specific targets is employed. One such example is the use of TNF-α inhibitors, such as adalimumab and infliximab. These biologics target specific inflammatory cytokines, unlike the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. JAK-STAT inhibitors (JAKinibs) are classified as targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (tsDMARDs), which are small-molecule drugs that are chemically synthesized rather than biologically derived. In contrast to biologic DMARDs or bDMARDs, tsDMARDs are smaller molecules that are orally available, nonimmunogenic, and capable of crossing the cell membrane. JAKinibs can simultaneously block multiple cytokine-signalling pathways, such as those driven by IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and IL-17, as they dampen Th1- and Th17-driven inflammation. This ability to target a broad range of inflammatory cytokines and immune pathways theoretically enables JAKinibs to be viable alternatives for the treatment of NIU resistant to conventional IMT and biologicals. JAK-STAT inhibitors, such as tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, peficitinib, delgocitinib, and filgotinib have been FDA-approved for use in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The available literature suggests the potential efficacy of these drugs in controlling uveitic inflammation; however, their use in NIU is still under investigation, with no randomized controlled trials providing Level I evidence.",

Data extraction was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The results focus on keywords such as DME, OCT, anti VEGF, and patient responses after anti VEGF injections. The article measures the effectiveness of different machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), ResNet-50, CNN with attention, quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM), in analyzing eyes that could tolerate extended interval dosing. According to a review of 50 relevant papers published between 2016 and 2023, the algorithms achieved an average automated sensitivity of 74% (95% CI: 0.55-0.92) in detecting treatment responses.",

The inclusion criteria comprised studies with available full text containing both papilledema and pseudopapilledema groups, with outcomes on sensitivity, specificity and/or area under the curve (AUC). This study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. A total of 510 participants were included from seven different studies, all encompassing groups of papilledema and pseudopapilledema with or without optic disc drusen (ODD). The studies demonstrated the favorable accuracy of RNFL in differentiating papilledema from pseudopapilledema, with AUC values ranging from 0.78 to 0.91. However, specificity and sensitivity varied between 65%-100% and 33%-91%, respectively. Lower accuracy was observed when pseudopapilledema included only patients with ODD or when papilledema was limited to mild cases. In conclusion, RNFL proves to be a reliable measurement for differentiating papilledema from pseudopapilledema.",

In vitro, MST1 overexpression was induced in RAW 264.7 cells via lentiviral transfection. Cell viability and proliferation were evaluated using the CCK-8 assay. The expression levels of NF-κB and NLRP3 signaling pathways in vitro or in vivo were analyzed using reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting analysis. The results showed that inhibition of MST1 expression attenuated lung damage, alleviated inflammation, enhanced antioxidant capacity, and inhibited the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3 pathways in vivo. In contrast, MST1 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and inflammation in vitro, accompanied by the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3 signaling pathways. This study demonstrated that MST1 activation contributed to inflammation in LPS-induced ALI by modulating the NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to verify the plasma profile of the androgens testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) throughout the sex differentiation of B. orbignyanus maintained in captivity and ultrastructurally verifying the basement membrane in specimens that underwent natural sex inversion. For this purpose, monthly collections (n = 15/month) were carried out from February to December 2018, and samples were collected from two months to one year of age. The specimens were euthanized, and blood, gonads and liver were collected. The plasma was subjected to steroid analysis, and the androgens T and 11-KT were quantified. The gonadosomatic (GSI) and hepatosomatic (HSI) indices were measured to assess the reproductive stages of fish, and the gonads were subjected to histological and ultrastructural analyses. Among all the animals analyzed, undifferentiated specimens, females in early differentiation, intersex specimens, males in early differentiation, and females with functional ovaries were identified, all of which were considered immature, in addition to males with functional testes considered able to produce sperm. No significant differences were found in the plasma T profile, while males able to produce sperm and intersex individuals had higher plasma concentrations of 11-KT than the other groups analyzed. Thus, it is suggested that sex inversion in females in Brycon orbignyanus is driven by the action of the androgen 11-KT.",

The aim of this observational study was to estimate the effect of post-infusion cooling time (PICT) on wearing a head cover for taxane- and anthracycline-based chemotherapies. The Dutch Scalp Cooling Registry (DSCR), which started in January 2006, collected data from 4680 scalp-cooled patients across 68 Dutch hospitals. Questionnaires on patient, chemotherapy and scalp cooling characteristics were completed by patients and nurses. The patient-reported primary outcome included the use of head covering during the final scalp cooling session. Analysis included patients who had received Docetaxel 75 or 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (D75 or D100), Paclitaxel 70-90 or 160-180 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (T70-90 or T160-180), Adriamycin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (AC), or 5-Fluorouracil 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> Epirubicin 90 or 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (FE90C or FE100C). Shorter post-infusion cooling times (< 85 minutes) seem to be sufficient for maintaining scalp cooling effectiveness in the chemotherapy regimens studied, with no added benefit from extending cooling time beyond this threshold.",

Forty consecutive cancer patients (mean age 61 years; 30 men, 10 women) were reviewed. For each patient, data regarding indication, the Child-Pugh (C-P) classification, international normalized ratio (INR), serum bilirubin level, creatinine level, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score before the procedure and 1 month after the procedure were collected. Clinical efficacy was evaluated based on response, defined as the absence of significant variceal bleeding or clinically detectable ascites or hydrothorax following TIPS placement. Technical safety, complications, overall survival (OS), and incidence of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) were also assessed. One month after TIPS, 31 (77.5%) patients had clinical response, and 9 (22.5%) had no response. The technical success rate was 100%. There were no major procedure-related complications. The primary indications for shunt creation were ascites in 18 (45%), variceal bleeding (47.5%), and hydrothorax (7.5%). The 1-, 3-, and 6-month mortality rates were 10%, 25%, and 40%, respectively. Among the 40 patients included, 24 (60%) had cirrhosis, most commonly due to hepatitis C infection, hepatitis B infection, alcoholic liver disease, or NASH. The remaining 16 patients (40%) were non-cirrhotic. The median MELD score pre-TIPS was 11.5 (range 6.5-20.1). C-P score before intervention included 4 (10%) cases in class A, 33 (82.5%) in B, and 3 (7.5%) in C. The median OS was 15.4 months (range 0.03-61 months) and significantly differed by C-P score for each group (P < 0.001). No significant correlations existed between OS and the MELD score or pre-TIPS laboratory data. Fourteen patients developed HE (34%) after the procedure, and only one patient (2.5%) required shunt reduction. Responders had significantly longer OS, with a median of 26.5 months compared to 1.1 months in non-responders (P < 0.001, 95% CI: 2.14-13.19). Nine (22.5%) patients had a stent placed through the tumor. Twenty-six patients (65%) had an unchanged C-P class after the procedure, while C-P worsened in 6 (15%) and improved in 4 (10%). These findings suggest that TIPS and its variations for the portosystemic shunt creation can be a safe and effective option for managing portal hypertension complications in carefully selected cancer patients with relatively preserved liver function. The study demonstrated high technical success and encouraging clinical response rates.",

      "content": "The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is key to understanding malignancy development. EMT is a critical regulatory mechanism for differentiating cell populations initially observed during the neural crest and embryonic gastrulation formation. This process is closely associated with tumor metastasis in cancer and is also related to the maintenance of cancer stem cells. Flavonoids, known for their antioxidant properties, have been widely studied for their anticancer potential to protect plants from harmful environmental conditions. They have attracted considerable attention and have been the focus of numerous experimental and epidemiological studies to evaluate their potential in cancer treatment. In vitro and in vivo research has demonstrated that flavonoids can significantly impact cancer-related EMT. They may inhibit the EMT process by reducing the levels of Twist1, N-cadherin, ZEB1, integrins, SNAI1/2, CD44, MMPs, and vimentin while increasing E-cadherin levels and targeting the PI3K/AKT, NF-κB p65, and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways. In order to suppress the transcription of the E-cadherin promoter, several Zn-finger transcription factors, such as SNAI2, ZEB1, and ZEB2, and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors, such as Twist, may directly bind to its E-boxes. Overall, clinical cancer research should integrate the anticancer properties of flavonoids, which address all phases of carcinogenesis, including EMT, to improve the prospects for targeted cancer therapies in patients suffering from aggressive forms of tumors.",

DTX and CRP cell viability against SMMC-7721 and Bel7402 cells by MTT test. The IC<sub>50</sub> values of CRP, DTX, and DTX + CRP for 35 μM, 4.69 μM, and 3.12 μM for SMMC-7721 cells, respectively. The outcomes of the respective fluorescence staining assays displayed that DTX + CRP remarkably enhanced the reactive oxygen species, diminished MMP, and triggered apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. DTX + CRP diminished the levels of GSH, CAT, and SOD while enhancing MDA contents in SMMC-7721 cell lines. In SMMC-7721 cells subjected to DTX + CRP, the Bax, Bcl-2, CyC, caspase-3, -8, and -9 expressions were fourfold increased, while Bcl-2 expression was threefold reduced. DTX + CRP enhanced the anticancer efficacy of human liver cancer cells by causing cellular oxidative stress. The hemocompatibility of DTX, CRP, and DTX + CRP was measured at different concentrations. Overall, the results indicate that these DTX + CRP possess potential biomedical uses due to their reduced hemotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and enhanced physiological milieu stability.",

We retrospectively analyzed 100 consecutive patients with CE that was diagnosed based on criteria encompassing clinical, angiographic and diagnostic imaging findings. We evaluated in-hospital and long-term outcomes. Among the 100 patients, 28 experienced adverse in-hospital events. In the univariate analysis, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, peak troponin I, lower LAS reservoir, atrial fibrillation (AF), right ventricular dysfunction (RVD), mitral regurgitation and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction were associated with in-hospital events. Multivariate analysis confirmed reduced LAS reservoir (OR 0.88, 95%CI 0.81-0.95; p = 0.03), AF (OR 15, 95%CI 1.4-168; p = 0.02), and RVD (OR 18, 95% CI 1.2-275; p = 0.04) as independent predictors of adverse in-hospital outcomes. After a median follow-up of 26 months, 21 patients (23%) experienced adverse long-term events. In the univariate analysis chronic kidney disease, STEMI presentation, RVD and lower LAS reservoir were associated with worse long-term outcomes. In multivariate analysis, reduced LAS reservoir (HR 0.9 (95%CI 0.84-0.98; p = 0.02)) remained a significant predictor of long-term adverse outcomes. On the log-rank test using the discriminatory cutoff value of LASr < 17.5%, LASr was associated with higher risk of long-term outcomes (p < 0.001). Reduced LAS is associated with worse in-hospital and long-term outcomes in patients with CE. These findings highlight the potential role of LAS as a valuable prognostic tool in CE.",

A key challenge is anticipating how environmental attributes and corresponding target attribute states will respond to climate change alongside impacts of local anthropogenic activities. We present a method to predict climate-driven shifts in target attribute states for suspended and deposited fine sediment, as specified in existing environmental policy for Aotearoa-New Zealand. The policy uses a river environment classification derived from climate, topography, and geology inputs to determine spatially-distributed target attribute states.",

Apparent spatial patterns in shifts to warmer and drier climate classes are anticipated for a considerable proportion of river segments under the highest future emissions scenario towards the end of century. Climate-driven shifts in class membership led to shifted target attribute states corresponding to either increased or decreased sediment targets depending on location, and the emergence of conditions that have no specified environmental targets because they fall outside of existing classes. Findings highlight the potential impact of climate change upon both target attribute states and actual fine sediment states which should be considered when devising environmental classifications and setting target attribute states. Our method offers a practical approach to anticipate climate-driven impacts on any environmentally-driven spatial classification used to derive management units and target attribute states.",

      "content": "The glycocalyx (GCX), a multicomponent coating on endothelial cells (ECs), plays a critical role in various cellular behaviors, including barrier formation, vasodilation, and mechanotransduction. Mechanical perturbations in the vascular environment, such as blood vessel stiffness, are sensed and transduced by ECs via the GCX. Hypertension-induced stiffness disrupts GCX-mediated mechanotransduction, leading to EC dysfunction and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Understanding GCX-regulated mechanotransduction necessitates an in vitro model that closely mimics in vivo conditions. Existing models are insufficient, prompting the development of the system described in this manuscript. Here, we report on a new system to model varying EC substrate stiffness under sustained physiological fluid shear stress, providing a realistic environment for comprehensive examination of EC function. Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) substrates with stiffnesses of 5 kPa (physiological) and 10 kPa (pathological) were seeded with human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and subjected to constant physiological shear stress (12 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 6 h.",

Compared to the 5 kPa conditions, HS coverage and thickness decreased at 10 kPa, indicating impaired barrier function and increased susceptibility to inflammatory agents. SA density increased despite decreased coverage, suggesting enhanced binding site availability for inflammatory recruitment. HA expression remained unchanged, but the amount of the HA core receptor, CD44, was found to be increased at 10 kPa. Consistent with previously published interactions between CD44 and YAP, we observed increased YAP activation at 10 kPa, as evidenced by increased nuclear translocation and decreased phosphorylation. These findings, bridging biomaterials and mechanobiology approaches, deepen our understanding of how mechanical stimuli influence the EC GCX function. The results underscore the potential of mechanotherapeutic strategies aimed at preserving vascular health by modulating the endothelial function.",

These PROTACs were able to efficiently degrade SRC-3 and inhibit the proliferation of wild-type and endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells. Notably, compound <b>BY13</b> could significantly inhibit the growth of drug-resistant breast tumors without observed toxicity in mice. Mechanism studies indicated that the degradation ability of these SRC-3 PROTAC degraders is ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) pathway-dependent. Moreover, <b>BY13</b> displays a highly selective blocking effect on the ER signaling pathway over that of the androgen receptor. This proof-of-concept study firmly confirms that SRC-3 is a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment and highlights <b>BY13</b> as a lead compound for developing novel therapeutics to overcome endocrine resistance in breast cancer.",

Despite individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) living longer with serious illness, healthcare professionals report inadequate training in this area. Additionally, IDD specialists consistently express discomfort and limited knowledge regarding HAPC. ObjectiveThis narrative review evaluates existing education and training models for hospice and palliative care (HAPC) professionals working with individuals with IDD, emphasizing the reciprocal educational needs between these two specialties. MethodsA comprehensive literature search was conducted in March 2024 across multiple databases, including Embase, PubMed, and CINAHL, using terms related to IDD, training, and palliative care. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, resulting in seven relevant studies providing insight into educational interventions for IDD and palliative care professionals. ResultsFindings indicate that while several studies demonstrate positive outcomes regarding knowledge, self-efficacy, and satisfaction among participants, there is a lack of standardized training and patient-centered metrics. Existing interventions largely focused on improving the knowledge of IDD staff regarding HAPC, with limited attention given to educating HAPC professionals on the nuances and complexities needs of people with IDD. ConclusionThis review underscores the importance of developing and implementing evidence-based and standardized training programs that encompass the needs of both HAPC and IDD specialists. Future research should prioritize inclusive educational frameworks that involve individuals with IDD and their families in the development process.",

These functional groups also exhibit a strong propensity to form hydrogen bonds with halogen ions, thereby effectively suppressing the formation of halogen vacancies and inhibiting ion migration. Furthermore, AMB impedes the adsorption of the spacer molecule phenylethylamine (PEA) on the octahedron surface and competes with PEA for coordination sites, thereby promoting the formation of well-aligned layered phases and enhancing exciton transfer efficiency. Consequently, we obtained spectrally stable sky-blue PeLEDs with a high external quantum efficiency of 22.42%. High-quality active-matrix array displays are further demonstrated, achieving precise independent control of each pixel. These displays exhibit superior brightness and color consistency, making them highly promising for advanced optoelectronic applications.",

We compiled all patients with bAVMs and FA from an institutional database, among which those treated with flow-diverters were extracted. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, aneurysm, and AVM characteristics were summarized. Management of both FA and bAVM were listed. Associated bleeding with dual antiplatelet therapy, aneurysm and bAVM obliteration, and follow-up hemorrhage of bAVM were reported as outcomes of interest. From a database of 1066 patients with bAVMs, a total of 5 patients with 7 FAs treated with pipeline embolization device (PED) were included. All aneurysm treatment preceded bAVM management. Spetzler-Martin grades were the following: II (n = 2.40%), III (n = 2.40%), and V (n = 1.20%), among which 1 presented with hemorrhage. Only 2 bAVMs (40%) were treated with radiosurgery, and none were obliterated at last follow-up. A total of 9 aneurysms were identified, with just 7 (77.8%) being flow-related and treated with flow-diversion. Three FA treatments (42.9%) received preprocedural Brilinta + Aspirin, with the rest being Plavix + Aspirin, and none of the bAVMs had ruptured while on dual-antiplatelet therapy. With average follow-up duration of 4.8 years, 85.7% (n = 6) of the treated aneurysms were obliterated at follow-up. PED use to treat for FAs in bAVMs demonstrated favorable risk profile. The effectiveness of FA obliteration with flow-diversion is also favorable and on par with regular non-bAVM aneurysms. The current data suggest PED as an option to manage FAs in bAVMs.",

We aimed to determine whether static anteriorly placed banana cages or expandable obliquely placed cages provide greater lordosis when performing open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with concomitant posterior column osteotomy (PCO). We performed a single-surgeon retrospective consecutive cohort study which compared patients who underwent transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion using a static anteriorly placed banana cage vs an expandable obliquely placed cage. All TLIFs were performed open with PCO and included patients with focal degenerative pathology as well as global spinal deformity. Patient data were collected preoperatively, at 6-month follow-up, and at the last available follow-up. The primary outcome was defined as the change in segmental lordosis (ΔSL) measured using 6-month postoperative upright lumbar spine x-rays. In total, 210 patients met inclusion criteria, including a total of 227 static cages and 100 expandable cages. The median ΔSL for the expandable cohort was significantly higher than the static cohort (6.1° [2.4, 8.4] vs 4.1° [1.3, 6.9], P = .016). This difference persisted after multivariate regression analyses and propensity score matching. Preoperative SL was found to have the greatest impact on ΔSL with a 3.23° increase for segments with preoperative SL < 15° compared with segments with preoperative SL ≥ 25° (P < .001). The overall median (T12-S1) delta lumbar lordosis (ΔLL) for all patients was 3.5° [-0.5, 10.2]. Although ΔLL was larger for static cages (median difference of 2.2°, P = .031), after propensity score matching, the expandable cage cohort experienced 3.24° greater ΔLL compared with the static cohort (P = .004). Open TLIFs performed in conjunction with a PCO yielded 2.0° greater median ΔSL when using expandable obliquely placed cages compared with using static anteriorly placed banana cages. This represents a 50% increase between static and expandable cages.",

Furthermore, the effect of FGF2 treatment on HPdLF mineralization was assessed after 3 and 5 weeks using Alizarin red S staining (BMK-R009: Bio Future Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). Treatment of HPdLFs with 20 ng/mL FGF2 increased the expression of CEMP1 and RUNX2 but did not significantly alter the expression of FGF2, FGFR1, and FGFR2. In HPdLFs exposed to mechanical stress, expression of FGFR1 and OCN was increased, whereas that of FGF2, CEMP1, CAP, GLUT1, ALP, and OPN was reduced considerably. Treatment of mechanically-stressed HPdLFs with FGF2 did not change FGF2 expression, but expression of FGFR1, CEMP1, CAP, and GLUT1 increased significantly. In addition, FGFR1 was significantly upregulated at the protein level, whereas cementoblast differentiation markers showed an upward trend. Mineralization showed no changes at 3 weeks. However, at 5 weeks, considerable mineralization was observed in mechanically-stressed cells continuously exposed to FGF2. Mechanical stress increases FGFR1 expression in HPdLFs. FGF2 promotes the differentiation of mechanical-stressed HPdLFs into cementoblasts and their mineralization.",

      "content": "Limited access to specialist weight management services (SWMS) restricts the implementation of novel obesity pharmacotherapy like GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in the United Kingdom's (UK) National Health Service (NHS). Second Nature, a commercial digital health company, offers a remotely delivered program combining GLP-1RA medication (semaglutide) with digital behavioural support, potentially providing a scalable solution. However, evidence for long-term effectiveness in this real-world context is limited. To evaluate the 12-month effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and potential cost-effectiveness of Second Nature's remotely-delivered, semaglutide-supported weight management program. This retrospective service evaluation analysed data from participants initiating the program between September and December 2023. The primary outcome was weight change at 12 months among participants with available data (completers). Secondary outcomes included retention, program engagement (measured by application 'Home' screen views), behavioural changes, side effects, participant experience (qualitative analysis), and a comparative cost analysis against NHS SWMS. An 'active subscription' was defined as maintaining a paid subscription for the full 12 months. Descriptive statistics and paired two-tailed t-tests evaluated outcomes. Data from 341 participants were included at baseline (82.8% women; mean age 49.0 years, SD 11.1; mean baseline BMI 37.9 kg/m², SD 6.9). At 12 months, 39.6% (n=135) maintained an active subscription, while 60.4% (n=206) had become inactive. Weight data at 12 months were available for 179 participants (52.5% of baseline cohort; 100% of active and 19.4% of inactive participants). Among completers who maintained an active subscription, the mean weight loss was 18.1 kg (SD 9.5; P<.001), representing 17.3% of starting weight. Overall, 77.7% of completers achieved ≥10% weight loss and 61.5% achieved ≥15%. Program engagement declined over time. Side effects also decreased, with 69.6% of respondents reporting none by month 12. Most participants completing the 12-month survey reported positive (34.2%) or neutral (56.7%) experiences. This evaluation suggests that remotely-delivered GLP-1RA-supported weight management can achieve significant weight loss in participants remaining engaged for 12 months.",

      "content": "This study aimed to validate the subtypes of APTs using transcriptome sequencing. We applied a clustering model developed for our previous study, in which we had successfully distinguished parathyroid cancer from adenomas using gene expression patterns. Sixteen patients with APT who had undergone parathyroidectomy were enrolled, and we analyzed their baseline data, pathologic reports, and follow-up records and performed transcriptome sequencing of their APT samples. We then used our clustering model to classify tumors as either cancer- or adenoma-type APTs and compared these results with clinical findings. The median age of patients was 48.9 years, with median calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels of 11.4 mg/dL and 420.0 pg/mL, respectively. Pathologic and immunohistochemical results did not reveal any remarkable differences between adenoma-type and cancer-type APTs. However, clustering analysis classified four of the 16 APTs as being cancer-type and 12 as being adenoma-type tumors. Cancer-type patients had a median age of 30.0 years, with median calcium and PTH levels of 12.6 mg/dL and 800.8 pg/mL, respectively, clinically resembling parathyroid cancer. One patient exhibited a somatic CDC73 two-hit mutation and positive WT1 staining, suggesting a high malignant potential. Clustering analysis through transcriptome sequencing shows promise for risk stratification of patients with APTs. For those classified as having cancer-type tumors, close monitoring and long-term follow-up may be warranted.",

To study the prevalence and impact of FD and its subgroups in an internet survey. A total of 54,127 respondents from 26 countries completed the survey including the Rome IV diagnostic questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), PHQ-12, PROMIS Global-10, demographics, and medical history. Respondents reporting a history of relevant organic disease, or fulfilling criteria for self-induced or cyclic vomiting, or cannabinoid hyperemesis were excluded. Rome IV FD prevalence was 7.2% (range 2.2%-12.3%), significantly higher in women and decreased with age. The most prominent subtype was postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) (66.6%). Rome IV IBS was found in 26.1% of those fulfilling FD criteria. Functional heartburn and chronic nausea and vomiting criteria were fulfilled in, respectively, 9.0% and 7.0%. Fulfilling FD symptom criteria was significantly associated with increased prevalence of anxiety and depression and with lower quality of life and higher healthcare seeking behaviour. Rome IV FD is one of the most prevalent DGBI globally. Across countries, it is associated with female sex, younger age, psychological distress, reduced quality of life, and higher health care utilisation. PDS is the dominant subgroup. Overlapping other DGBI are present in a minority.",

High-throughput optical screening of bilayer coupling layers further enhances light utilization efficiency to 9.8% (N + N) and 9.3% (W + N) through optimized light management.

However, their development has been hindered by reduced thermal performance, often caused by structural collapse during the transition from solution to solid. Inspired by natural goose down, a bio-based, lightweight insulation foam derived from agricultural waste straw is presented. Through in situ synthesis, bio-silica fibers with branched structures capable of supporting hollow silica microspheres are fabricated. After steam-mediated processing, the resulting foam exhibit low density (95 mg cm<sup>-</sup> <sup>3</sup>), high porosity (95.5%), low thermal conductivity (0.03 ± 0.003 W mK<sup>-1</sup>), and a cyclic compressive strength of 90 kPa at 50% strain. Owing to the synergistic microstructure formed by branched bio-fibers and hollow silica spheres, the bio-silica foam exhibit outstanding thermal insulation performance relative to other bio-based foams prepared by ambient drying. A passivated insulation panel is further developed by incorporating this material as the core component, achieving a thermal conductivity of 0.0275 W mk<sup>-1</sup> and flexural strength of 6.85 MPa.

To address this gap, the present study aims to describe patients' experience of trauma-adapted yoga (TAY) as a health-promoting activity in forensic psychiatric care. Twelve individual semi-structured interviews with patients in forensic psychiatric care were conducted, and data were analysed using inductive content analysis. The patients' experience of TAY as a health-promoting activity was captured in an overarching theme, \"To feel that one is connected to mind, body, and soul in a way that can promote a sense of well-being in an uncertain existence\". This overarching theme contained four themes: <i>Strengthening the body</i>, <i>finding a calm place within oneself, something to do solely for oneself but together with others</i>, and <i>prerequisites for doing yoga</i>. The findings emphasize that TAY has the potential to be a valuable health-promoting activity for patients in forensic psychiatric care by facilitating their resources to manage stressors in everyday life.",

      "content": "However, the role of nanoscale heterostructures formed by non-metal atoms in regulating the electronic state of catalysts is often overlooked. In this work, these electronic states are modulated by in situ constructing a Mo─S heterostructure in a Mo<sub>2</sub>C nanosphere. The introduction of sulfur atoms forms the anion heterointerface, altering the coordination environment of interfacial Mo atoms and strengthening Mo─S interactions. This modification significantly enhances lithium polysulfide (LiPS) adsorption and conversion kinetics when using a Mo<sub>2</sub>C-MoS<sub>2</sub> heterostructure-modified separator (Mo<sub>2</sub>C-MoS<sub>2</sub>/PP) in LSBs. Furthermore, Mo<sub>2</sub>C-MoS<sub>2</sub>/PP effectively suppresses the LiPS shuttle effect and improves cycling stability, achieving a low capacity decay rate of 0.036% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1C. This study proposes a comprehensive approach to modulate metal electronic states by non-metal atoms nanoheterostructure, aiming to enhance the catalytic reaction kinetics of LSBs.",

Serum BDNF levels were measured within the first 72 hours following stroke diagnosis. On the 14th day following stroke diagnosis, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17), and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) were applied to the patients. ResultsSerum BDNF levels (<i>P</i> = 0.022) and MoCA values (<i>P</i> = 0.004) of patients with early-onset PSD were significantly lower, and NIHSS values (<i>P</i> = 0.027) were significantly higher compared to patients without early-onset PSD. There was a significantly negative correlation between BDNF value and HAMD-17 score and lymphocytes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to investigate the extent the BDNF level could predict the occurrence of early-onset PSD and cut-off values were determined. For a BDNF cut-off value of 361.51, sensitivity and specificity values were 75% and 56.2%, respectively, which indicated that BDNF may be a useful indicator associated with early-onset PSD. ConclusionLower serum BDNF levels are associated with early-onset PSD and may serve as a potential biomarker, although causal or predictive conclusions are limited due to the study's cross-sectional design.",

Hellebrigenin demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against NPC-BM and NPC-039 cell lines without harming normal nasopharyngeal cells. Treatment with hellebrigenin resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest in both NPC cell lines. The apoptotic phenomena induced by hellebrigenin included chromatin condensation, increased apoptotic cells and altered mitochondrial membrane potential. Proteomics analysis and the bioinformatic data identified coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2) as a candidate oncogene in NPC. Moreover, the combination of CHCHD2 siRNA, CHCHD2 plasmid and hellebrigenin pointed out that CHCHD2 could be a critical mediator of hellebrigenin-induced apoptosis. The combined treatment of hellebrigenin with mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors revealed the involvement of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases pathways in hellebrigenin-induced apoptosis in NPC cells. In vivo studies demonstrated that hellebrigenin suppressed the tumour volume without affecting body weight, accompanied by the downregulation of Ki67 and CHCHD2 expression. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that hellebrigenin induces NPC apoptosis through regulating CHCHD2 both in vitro and in vivo.",

These groups act as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates for tin-based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). This study is the first example to report the use of porphyrin as SAM for TPSCs. In the presence of SAMs, the devices achieved efficiencies in the following order: MC-4 (8.65%) > MC-3 (6.19%) > MC-2 (5.06%) > MC-1 (5.03%). The outstanding performance of the MC-4 device is attributed to its retarded charge recombination, increased hole mobility, and superior hole-extraction capability. This approach offers a promising pathway for further developing porphyrin-based TPSCs.",
