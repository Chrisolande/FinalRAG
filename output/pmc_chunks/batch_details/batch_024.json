      "content": "Although several large clinical trials have shown that endovascular treatment (EVT) is beneficial for patients with large core infarction, their outcomes were still much worse than those with mild infarction. Therefore, given the cerebral collateral recycle (CCR) as an effective prognostic marker, this study explored the relationship between CCR and clinical outcomes in patients with large ischemic infarct. We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (AIS-LVO). Extensive baseline infarction was defined by ASPECTS ≤5 on admission computed tomography (CT). CCR was determined by quantifying pial arterial collaterals and venous outflow (VO) based on admission CT angiography.",

Among 860 AIS-LVO patients receiving EVT, 140 patients met the inclusion criteria. In multivariable binary logistic regression analysis, compared with the unfavorable CCR group, the favorable CCR group had a higher rate of favorable outcomes at 90 days (84.62 % vs 32.46 %, aOR 8.08, 95 % CI 2.13-30.62, P = .002). In a subgroup analysis, similar results were found that favorable CCR group achieved a higher proportion of 90-day mRS 0-3. The favorable collateral circulation including arterial inflow combined with venous outflow in AIS-LVO patients with extensive baseline infarction is associated with better clinical outcomes. CCR status could serve as a valuable imaging biomarker for outcomes prediction.",

Trained examiners assessed social developmental scores of 1860 healthy infants (0-24 months; mean age: 9.1 months, SD = 6.5) via a standardized developmental test. An adjusted regression model showed significantly lower social developmental T-values (B = -1.790, 95 % CI: [-2.682; -0.898) for infants examined during the pandemic as well as for infants with a longer duration of exposure to the pandemic (B = -0.131, 95 % CI: [-0.239; -0.023]). The effect was partially mediated by maternal media use (direct effect: B = -1.35; total effect: B = -1.65, p < .05). Infants up to 11 months predominantly showed difficulties with engaging in dyadic interaction and emotion regulation, while in children up to 24 months of age items indicative of prosocial behavior were fulfilled less frequently. While there seems to be a small effect of being examined during the pandemic on infants' social development, children were in a non-delayed range of development. Although it only had a small impact on social development, parents should be educated on responsible media use. Longitudinal studies might offer further insights on additional influencing factors and long-term effects of the pandemic on infant social development.",

Aspergillus niger lipase cross-linked with starch support and enzyme immobilization was optimized for various parameters, viz., different cross linkers, percent of cross-linkers, concentration of enzyme, etc. Reusability of the lipase-immobilized film was obtained 11 times, which is sensitive to detect insecticides. Surface morphology of starch and lipase-immobilized starch films were examined by scanning electron microscopy, and functional groups involved in immobilization was determined by FTIR. A comparative study of the biochemical parameters, viz., optimum pH, temperature, effect of metal ions, and organic solvents on the native and immobilized lipase, was carried out. Stability of immobilized and native lipase activity in different organic media was evaluated for different time intervals. Thermal stability was checked at optimum temperature (50 <sup>°</sup>C) for various time intervals.",

      "content": "To evaluate the most effective development methods for mobile applications that support self-management of non-communicable diseases and to determine the features that enhance their effectiveness and user adoption. The design was a systematic review of research papers published in the period 2019-2024. The review included randomized and quasi-experimental clinical trials. The search was performed in six databases (PubMed, Scopus, Scielo, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Clinical Trials). Bias and methodological quality were assessed using the RoB2 and MINORS tools. The review included six studies involving 2421 patients across four countries. The applications demonstrated improvements in treatment adherence, self-efficacy, and control of clinical variables such as glycemia and blood pressure. The most effective applications incorporated therapeutic education, monitoring, and reminders. However, limitations were noted, including insufficient user involvement in early development stages, which could affect relevance and usability. The heterogeneity of study designs and populations, coupled with the lack of large-scale clinical trials, limits the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, variability in technological platforms and the absence of standardized evaluation metrics complicate outcome comparisons. Mobile applications for chronic disease self-management are most effective when developed with a user-centered approach and continuous validation. Despite these findings, further research is necessary to generalize the results and optimize the integration of these applications into healthcare systems.",

Gross and histological placental morphology was analysed, and bulk RNA-sequencing conducted. Placentae of Inha WT, Het and KO fetuses exhibited no gross morphological differences or differentially expressed genes. However, WT males compared to WT females displayed significantly increased placenta size and labyrinth area. DEHP exposure significantly increased fetal resorption at E15.5 but yielded limited differences in placental morphology. Sex- and genotype-specific transcript alterations in DEHP-exposed placentae included four carcinoembryonic antigen family transcripts (Ceacam13, Gm5155, Psg18, Psg-ps1) and four additional trancripts (Cts3, Ssr4, Sec11c, Taf7l) altered in all genotypes. Despite minimal morphological changes, transcriptomic differences suggest that spongiotrophoblast cells and syncytiotrophoblast giant cells are DEHP exposure targets, with carcinoembryonic antigen family transcripts susceptible to its effects. Additionally, DEHP modulates placental gene transcript levels when activin A is unopposed in vivo.",

Using transmission electron microscopy techniques, we describe in detail the characteristics of these cells. Typical sperm have characteristics common to Heteroptera, including an acrosome positioned anteriorly to the nucleus, which later elongates laterally to it; two symmetrical mitochondrial derivatives in a \"half-moon\" shape connected to the axoneme by two bridges; and the absence of accessory bodies. In contrast, aberrant spermatozoa have a rounded acrosome that does not extend laterally to the nucleus until the nucleus-flagellum transition region. Furthermore, the mitochondrial derivatives of these spermatozoa are considerably thicker, reaching up to five times the diameter observed in typical spermatozoa. However, both morphotypes exhibit the synapomorphies of Heteroptera. These structural distinctions indicate a marked morphological variation that may be associated with specific functions or reproductive strategies of the species. These new morphological data are possibly specific to the genus Edessa, or perhaps to the Edessinae. They may be complementary tools for resolving taxonomic and phylogenetic questions for this diverse group.",

      "content": "During simulated digestion, surimi supplemented with crayfish shell powder exhibited reduced protein digestibility and hydrolysis. Furthermore, compared to surimi without crayfish shell powder, these samples showed larger digestate particle size, enhanced cholesterol-lowering activity, and increased release of essential amino acids. These changes were most significant (p < 0.05) in the MID-supplemented surimi. Peptidomics analysis revealed that crayfish shell powder reduced peptide release by inhibiting structural protein hydrolysis and enriching lipid-regulatory pathways. These effects were linked to the dense gel network formed by the crayfish shell powder, limiting enzyme accessibility. In conclusion, crayfish shell powder reduced protein digestibility, thereby potentially influencing the satiating effect of surimi while improving its nutritional profile, positioning it as a promising functional additive for health-promoting surimi food applications.",

H5N1-vaccinated mice exhibited reduced serum neutralizing antibody titers, despite the hemagglutinin-binding immunoglobulin production being similar to that with other IAV vaccines. Although bulk RNA sequencing showed no differences in B-cell populations after H5N1 and H1N1pdm09 vaccination, H5N1 vaccination resulted in fewer, but larger, dLN germinal centers and significantly more extrafollicular B cells, which are known to produce lower neutralizing antibody titers. Furthermore, H5N1-vaccinated mice had significantly more follicular helper and regulatory T cells. Therefore, differences in neutralizing antibody production in mice after IAV vaccination correlate with subtype-dependent germinal center reactions in the dLNs.",

However, whether these differences lead to sex-specific variations in VOC emissions and herbivore resistance across multi-trophic levels remains unclear. In this study, we used full-sibs of female and male poplars to investigate how soil cadmium (Cd) stress and plant sex influence emissions of constitutive plant volatiles (CPVs) and herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) as well as associated multi-trophic interactions. We showed that Cd exposure qualitatively and quatitatively affected CPV and HIPV emissions in both sexes, particularly in males, which emitted less CPVs but more HIPVs than females under Cd stress. Insect bioassays demonstrated that Cd-exposed males were more effective at deterring generalist and specialist herbivores, while becoming more attractive to parasitic wasps than Cd-exposed females. We identified 3-methylbutyronitrile as the key compound driving enhanced repellency against herbivorous insects, while methyl salicylate was primarily responsible for increased attractiveness to parasitic wasps. These results suggest that male plants may be better suited for phytoremediation in metal-contaminated areas amid escalating global pollution and herbivory pressure.",

      "content": "However, our understanding towards the transfer-transformation-mitigation pathways and related mechanism of Tl stemming from different pollution sources remains inadequate, potentially hindering effective pollution prevention, management, and monitoring strategies in the face of escalating Tl contamination in aquatic environments. This review seeks to offer a thorough analysis of the primary sources of Tl pollution, and clarify its environmental impacts in water bodies. To date, apart from the well-known sources of Tl pollution (i.e. industrial activities involving Tl-bearing sulfide minerals, including pyrite, sphalerite, galena, and carlin-type gold deposits), large quantities of Tl pollutants may stem from the extraction and industrial activities of other Tl-enriched critical metallic minerals (e.g. Li, and rare earth element) as the global shift towards clean and renewable energy sources. Relevant studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of Tl in aquatic environments exert profound detrimental effects on benthic and ichthyofauna in aquatic ecosystem. These impacts may lead to a series of alterations at the physiological, biochemical, and genomic expression levels. Notably, there is no consolidated Tl concentration limits for wastewater discharge globally regardless of relatively consistent drinking water standards. Such disruptions can, in turn, compromise the survival and demographic structure of these organisms, ultimately jeopardizing human beings through complex trophic networks. Given the urgency of this situation, there is a pressing need for establishing function-dependent water quality benchmarks with regards to various Tl-containing or polluted aquatic environments, thus to curb the growing thallium contamination for the age of low carbon.",

      "content": "It has been demonstrated that this toxin can induce oxidative stress and inflammation, which can result in liver damage in humans and animals. Exosomes have the capacity to carry active substances, and when these particles are released into the blood, they can transport these substances to other cells, thereby affecting the health of the body. However, the specific mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. This study was conducted with the objective of investigating the exosome-mediated liver injury of ZEA in rats and its possible mechanism. Firstly, the systemic toxic effects of ZEA exposure were clarified at the animal level. It was found that ZEA induced an elevation in the levels of exosome in the serum of rats. Subsequent analysis determined that the main source of exosomes were the liver. Secondly, transcriptomics was used to screen out the microRNAs (miRNA) let-7d-3p in exosomes, which may mediate the liver damage induced by ZEA. Furthermore the mechanism of exosomes and miRNA let-7d-3p involved in the hepatotoxicity induced by ZEA was explored. Compared with database, we clarified that ZEA caused liver damage through the let-7d-3p/Arid5a signaling pathway. This study revealed the role of exosomes on intercellular communication in ZEA hepatotoxicity, providing a new perspective for ZEA toxicity and its prevention and control.",

All amyloid-positive participants in Cohort 1 completed one-year follow-up. CSF amyloid-β(Aβ)42, Aβ40, p-tau181, and t-tau were measured. Amyloid status defined by CSF Aβ42/40 ratio (positive: < 0.1; negative: ≥ 0.1). Four types of microplastics, namely polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), and polystyrene, were detected in human CSF. Bottled water consumption frequency and CSF/serum albumin ratio significantly correlated with CSF microplastic abundance. In Cohort 1, amyloid-positive subjects exhibited significantly elevated CSF levels of PE and PVC as compared to amyloid-negative subjects. In amyloid-positive subjects (Cohort 1 and 2), CSF PE levels showed significant inverse correlations with both CSF Aβ42 levels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. In amyloid-positive individuals of Cohort 1, elevated PE levels positively correlated with MMSE decline rate over one year. The levels of CSF Aβ42 served as an intermediary factor, significantly affecting the relationship between CSF PE and MMSE scores in amyloid-positive subjects of cohort 1. In Cohort 1, the CSF levels of PE and PVC demonstrated an area under the curve value of greater than 0.8, indicating their strong potential to differentiate between amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative individuals. These discoveries suggested that the gradual accumulation of microplastics in the CSF were associated with cognitive decline among AD individuals.",

      "content": "This study aimed to assess the association between total bilirubin and early-stage PD. The ultimate goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the implications of this relationship between total bilirubin and early-stage PD. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study involving 1631 participants which collected from 2010 to 11 December 2024 in PPMI cohort. Logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analyses were employed to validate the research objectives. The overall prevalence of PD was 81.5 % (1329/1631). Specifically, the prevalence was 78.0 % (294/377) for total bilirubin tertile 1 (T1, 3-7 μmol/L), 80.8 % (498/616) for tertile 2 (T2, 7-10 μmol/L), and 84.2 % (537/638) for tertile 3 (T3, 10-48 μmol/L), respectively (P = 0.043). Multivariate odds ratio regression adjusted for risk factors demonstrates a 5-unit increment in the total bilirubin raises the risk of early-stage PD by 1.16 times, respectively. Smooth splines analysis suggested a linear association between levels of total bilirubin and risk of early-stage PD (P nonlinearity = 0.968). Further exploratory subgroup analysis within the age, sex, BMI, and MCI groups showed that there were no significant interactions between the subgroups (all P values for interaction were >0.05). Additional sensitivity analyses supported the primary findings and indicated the conclusions are robust. The observed association between elevated total bilirubin levels and early-stage PD risk suggests that bilirubin may serve as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and disease monitoring.",

We completed appetite hormone measurements (e.g., insulin, leptin, and ghrelin) and cognitive function assessments. Loneliness was classified into low (≤ 40) and moderate/high (>40) levels on the basis of total scores on the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Adolescents with ADHD exhibited greater appetite hormone dysregulation, especially increased leptin levels, than the NTD adolescents did, regardless of loneliness level. The adolescents in the ADHD-moderate/high loneliness group had the poorest executive function (p = .018). Our study was the first to clarify the potential role of loneliness in the cognitive dysfunction and appetite hormone dysregulation associated with ADHD. The co-condition of ADHD and loneliness was related to greater impairment in executive function. Increased levels of leptin were more specific to ADHD than loneliness. Further longitudinal follow-up studies are required to clarify the temporal associations between executive dysfunction, appetite hormone dysregulation, and loneliness among patients with ADHD. The treatment program targeted at loneliness may be developed for adolescents with ADHD, especially those who exhibited greater executive dysfunction.",

      "content": "This review looks at different aspects of PCNL evolution with procedural and technological advancements, with specific aspects of history, positioning, imaging and puncture, tract dilation, miniaturization, and lithotripsy devices. <b><i>Material and Methods:</i></b> We conducted a thorough search in October 2024 across multiple databases, social media platforms, and Google with specific terms and Boolean operators to determine the main dates for the development of individual PCNL stages. To be more specific, the main focus was on identifying chronological events that led to the evolution of PCNL with respect to these six categories: (1) history of PCNL; (2) patient positioning; (3) imaging and puncture; (4) tract dilation; (5) nephroscope size; and (6) lithotripsy devices. <b><i>Results:</i></b> All six aspects that have been investigated have undergone significant changes, leading to the modernization of PCNL in the 21st century. There is a trend toward supine position, miniaturization of instruments, an increase in image quality, the active development of various imaging modalities, and the integration of various digital and prototyping technologies. There are tools to help with puncture and needle guidance, as well as the emergence of navigation and robotic systems. Tract dilation seems to move toward single-step approach rather than serial dilatation. Major discoveries in energy sources such as lasers have now been incorporated into lithotripsy for PCNL. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The modernization of PCNL has been a result of multiple evolutions along its journey, from imaging advancements, lithotripsy devices, miniaturization, learning from cross-disciplinary techniques, and digital integration with the use of virtual and augmented reality. While the journey continues to evolve, we summarize the key milestones that have led to the current clinical standard of practice.",

Subgroup analyses indicated enhanced benefits in older adults, males, individuals with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m², and diabetic patients. The beneficial effects were pronounced in patients with advanced fibrosis. Ginkgo biloba supplementation is associated with improved survival and reduced cardiovascular and renal risks in MASLD patients, particularly in high-risk subgroups. These findings highlight the potential of Ginkgo biloba as an adjunctive therapy in MASLD management. This is the first large-scale study to examine the potential impact of Ginkgo biloba supplementation on clinical outcomes in MASLD, with fibrosis-stratified analyses providing insights into its differential effects across disease severity.",

This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the S. aureus proteome using network-based interactomics and high-throughput reverse screening techniques to identify promising vaccine candidates. We employed a computational proteome screening platform that integrated data from various sources, including experimental findings from a thorough literature review. By combining these datasets, we identified eighteen protein vaccine targets that demonstrated strong potential in eliciting an immune response against S. aureus. This approach is significant as it sheds light on the crucial pathways involved in the survival and pathogenesis of S. aureus while identifying key proteins within these pathways involved in its pathogenesis. This study serves as a proof-of-principle, demonstrating the potential of a customized platform designed specifically to discover vaccine candidates against S. aureus and tackle its canonical infections.",

      "content": "As a widely-used machine translation task, text image machine translation (TIMT) aims to translate the source texts embedded in the image to target translations. However, studies in this aspect face two challenges: (1) constructed in a cascaded manner, dominant models suffer from the error propagation of optical character recognition (OCR), and (2) they lack publicly available large-scale datasets. To deal with these issues, we propose a multimodal codebook based TIMT model. In addition to a text encoder, an image encoder, and a text decoder, our model is equipped with a multimodal codebook that effectively associates images with relevant texts, thus providing useful supplementary information for translation. Particularly, we present a multi-stage training framework to fully exploit various datasets to effectively train our model. Concretely, we first conduct preliminary training on the text encoder and decoder using bilingual texts. Subsequently, via an additional code-conditioned mask translation task, we use the bilingual texts to continuously train the text encoder, multimodal codebook, and decoder. Afterwards, by further introducing an image-text alignment task and adversarial training, we train the whole model except for the text decoder on the OCR dataset. Finally, through the above training tasks except for text translation, we adopt a TIMT dataset to fine-tune the whole model. Besides, we manually annotate a Chinese-English TIMT dataset, named OCRMT30K, and extend it to Chinese-German TIMT dataset through an automatic translation tool. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first public manually-annotated TIMT dataset, which facilitates future studies in this task.",

      "content": "Both nanocages exhibited excellent structural stability and formed favorable interactions with procarbazine through chemisorption phenomena. These interactions ensure robust chemical attraction while preserving the structural integrity of the procarbazine. Thermodynamic analyses confirmed that the adsorption process is energetically favorable, and that B<sub>12</sub>N<sub>12</sub> nanocage shows a stronger interaction compared to the C<sub>24</sub> system. Electronic property evaluations, including Density of States (DOS) and Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP), indicated that the nanocages do not negatively impact the electronic properties of procarbazine. Furthermore, HOMO-LUMO analyses revealed enhanced stability and change in the reactivity for the drug upon adsorption without compromising its anticancer efficacy. AIMD simulations at physiological temperature confirmed the structural stability of the procarbazine-nanocage complexes, with no dissociation observed. Additionally, the docking studies were conducted to evaluate the interaction potential of various compounds with a 16BP-DNA strand (CACTACAATGTTGCAAT) selected for its low guanine content (15 %). Blind docking of procarbazine revealed stable adducts with binding energies ranging from -4.08 to -5.95 kcal/mol. Procarbazine and other ligands demonstrated greater stability when forming adducts with guanine, suggesting that this interaction plays a critical role in stabilizing compound-DNA adducts. These findings underscore the potential of C<sub>24</sub> and B<sub>12</sub>N<sub>12</sub> nanocages as promising candidates for biomedical applications.",

Forty-one studies were identified for inclusion in the review, published between 1990 and 2022. Data were narratively synthesised due to heterogeneity in study designs. Results of the data synthesis indicate there is an inverse relationship between anxiety and gestational age or preterm birth. This relationship may be dependent upon timing of assessment, and measure of anxiety used. Assessing anxiety at a single timepoint may not be as accurate as assessments across all three trimesters. Concerted efforts should be made to distinguish between spontaneous preterm birth and medically indicated preterm birth, as anxieties during pregnancy may present differently between the two groups. Future studies should consider the assessment of anxiety across trimesters to assess change in mood, as well as the use of pregnancy-specific measures alongside general measures to support intervention during pregnancy.",

Digital health tools offer the potential to provide cost-effective, accessible, and scalable mental health care for refugees. However, these technologies are often not designed with marginalised and socially disadvantaged groups in mind, limiting their suitability for refugee populations. This narrative review critically examines the supply-side (characteristics of the mental health system) and demand-side (characteristics of the patient population) barriers of digital health tools for refugee mental health.

The Visual Analog Scale and 5-D Itch Scale were also administered once to the same group to assess convergent validity. Statistically significant positive correlations were found between the Itch Man Scale and both the Visual Analog Scale (r = 0.767, p < 0.001) and the 5-D Itch Scale (r = 0.665, p < 0.001). The test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.915.

      "content": "S. states including Tennessee. In March 2025 (early spring), we observed the typical symptom of powdery mildew, white powdery fungal growth, on leaves and stems of cilantro cultivated in two commercial green houses in Eagleville, TN. A disease incidence of 78% was recorded from 250 randomly selected cilantro plants across 25 rows. The disease severity was estimated at 54% based on a 0-5 scale disease rating (Behera et al., 2024). Microscopic examination of the fungal pathogen revealed epiphytic hyaline mycelia and upright unbranched conidiophores measuring 83-107 × 7.70-11.35 μm, which arose from cylindrical slightly curved foot cells measuring 26-43 × 8-13 μm. Conidia were ellipsoid to ovoid, produced singly and measured 24-47 × 11-16 μm. No chasmothecia, the sexual fruiting bodies, were observed in the infected samples. Based on these morphological characteristics, the pathogen was identified as Erysiphe heraclei. To further confirm identification, genomic DNA was extracted from conidiophores and conidia and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified using primers ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al., 1990). A ~700 bp amplicon was obtained and sequenced bidirectionally. The resulting sequence (Acc. No. PV489566) showed 100% similarity with E. heraclei and E. betae, which have been previously reported on cilantro in Mexico (LC777887) and on Swiss chard in South Africa (PQ220062), respectively. Based on the host specificity of E. heraclei, which is known to infect only plants within the Apiaceae family (Braun, 2012), the pathogen associated with powdery mildew on cilantro was confirmed as E. heraclei. Koch's postulates were further confirmed through rub inoculation, whereby infected leaves were gently rubbed onto the healthy leaves of 30-day-old cilantro plants [2-3 plants per pot; (n = 10 pots)] and maintained under greenhouse conditions at 22 °C with a 16:8 h light and dark cycle. Six days post-inoculation, characteristic powdery mildew symptoms, white powdery patches, appeared on the treated leaves while no symptoms were observed in the uninoculated control plants (n = 3 pots). Microscopic and molecular analyses of the fungi on inoculated plants matched that of the original isolate. Based on both morphological and molecular analyses, the fungal pathogen causing powdery mildew on cilantro was confirmed as E. heraclei. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented occurrence of E. heraclei infecting cilantro in the United States. Therefore, implementing appropriate preventive measures is crucial to minimize potential yield losses, particularly under protected cultivation conditions.",

Current ventilation devices in immediate newborn care lack integrated sensors and supporting mechanisms for medical professionals. This is a potential field of improvement, as safe ventilation relies on accurate pressure administration in current t-piece resuscitators. As the needed support during the process is currently limited, it highlights the demand for innovations in neonatal ventilation technology to improve efficacy and reduce potential errors. The objective of the study was to facilitate collaboration between medical and engineering experts to evaluate the critical factors for the successful implementation of an innovative ventilation technology in clinical immediate newborn care. Incorporating the views of medical professionals into the survey is expected to offer valuable insights to engineers for subsequent technological refinement. An international multicenter online survey was conducted among 51 neonatal health care professionals in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) in order to (1) assess the specific functionalities required in a neonatal ventilation assistant in immediate newborn care from a medical technology viewpoint, (2) characterize the acceptance of such a device as support tool using the extended technology acceptance model, and (3) identify further steps toward integration of such technologies.",

In this study, we report an efficient air-liquid-solid triphase oxidase enzymatic reaction and bioassay system that utilizes hollow hydrophobic@hydrophilic amphiphilic nanospheres as oxygen nanocarriers. The unique hollow porous structure and hydrophobic internal surface facilitate the storage of oxygen for oxidase enzymatic reactions as revealed by single nanoparticle dark-field microscopy. The outer hydrophilic layer facilitates uniform coating of the oxidase and ensures effective contact with the aqueous solution. This configuration creates an interfacial microenvironment that promotes rapid gas and liquid mass transfer, subsequently increasing the reaction rate of glucose oxidase (a model enzyme) catalysis by a factor of 6.6. Consequently, the triphase bioassay demonstrates superior performance in glucose detection, exhibiting a linear range of up to 30 mM, which is 15 times greater than that of the diphase system. Moreover, the triphase system has great potential for the determination of various biomarkers.",

      "content": "Here, we identify BCLAF1 as a regulator of HSC repopulation activity with functions in expansion of fetal HSCs and hematopoietic reconstitution after stem cell transplantation. Using mice with hematopoietic-specific and inducible deletion of Bclaf1, we find that BCLAF1 promotes fetal HSC development but is dispensible for maintenance of adult HSCs at steady state. Loss of BCLAF1 in either fetal or adult HSCs significantly impairs their self-renewal and multi-lineage reconstitution activity after stem cell transplantation. Single-cell RNA sequencing of fetal hematopoietic progenitors reveals that loss of BCLAF1 reduces long-term HSCs and restrains expression of stress response genes. BCLAF1 associates with chromatin throughout the genome of fetal and adult hematopoietic cells, likely through indirect mechanisms, to regulate transcriptional programs. These results establish a novel function for the transcriptional regulator BCLAF1 in limiting stress responses in HSCs to preserve HSC development during embryogenesis and repopulation function after stem cell transplant.",

Willingness to exposure increased only in the FutureMe condition. Distress and emotionality decreased in both conditions. Vividness decreased only in the control condition. Emotion regulation difficulties moderated the pre-post change of distress and emotionality only within the control condition. This study shows that the FutureMe could improve children's willingness to exposure, which in clinical practice could lead to less drop-out in anxiety therapy for children.

In phase I, in-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted with 22 participants to gather detailed information about the key barriers and facilitators for testing. We applied a thematic approach for qualitative analysis. The themes identified informed the development of a questionnaire with the main barriers and facilitators for phase II. The questionnaire was distributed electronically, and the target sample size was 400 participants. We performed descriptive analyses of the questionnaire data, reporting the most frequently mentioned barriers and facilitators for HIV and viral hepatitis testing. The study received financial support in the framework of the Global Health Protection Programme by the Federal Government of Germany. Data collection took place in June 2024 for phase I and in November 2024 for phase II. Data analyses and writing up of results will be done in early 2025 and results are expected to be published in spring 2025. The results of the study will improve the understanding of existing barriers and facilitators to HIV and viral hepatitis testing in order to increase testing offers and uptake in primary health care settings in the Kyrgyz Republic. Importantly, the findings will inform steps to improve the implementation of the new testing strategy and, ultimately, increase the number of people diagnosed and treated in the Kyrgyz Republic.

      "content": "Histopathological examination of a biopsy from a clinically suspicious lesion is still the gold standard for the diagnosis of oral cancer. Adjunctive techniques such as autofluorescence, toluidine blue (TB), and others have been evaluated among high-risk individuals such as chronic tobacco chewers or in patients with suspicious lesions. However, evaluation of these noninvasive adjunctive techniques has not been performed in primary health care settings. Since the first point-of-contact of individuals living in rural and semiurban areas are the primary health care workers, evaluation of these noninvasive adjuncts is likely to assist and strengthen the population-wide oral cancer screening in high-burden countries such as India. This prospective longitudinal study aims to evaluate the noninvasive adjuncts in oral cancer screening in the field settings, specifically in detecting foci of oral cancers in various OPMDs. After staff recruitment and training, we shall conduct oral cancer screening camps in the community for the recruitment of individuals with OPMDs after obtaining informed consent. All patients with OPMD shall undergo further screening via autofluorescence and TB staining for detection of lesions suspicious of oral cancer. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of these adjunctive techniques (autofluorescence and TB) in the detection of oral cancer shall be calculated using biopsy as the gold standard. In addition, this study will also focus on the validation of the 2022 consensus guidelines on risk-based stratification and appropriate management protocols for the OPMDs at the primary and referral health care centers. Our primary outcome is the diagnostic use of autofluorescence and TB in oral cancer detection among OPMDs as well as the robustness of the risk-based management protocols for these patients. Participant recruitment has been initiated at all sites. Staff recruitment and training in the oral visual examination have been conducted. Procurement of the autofluorescence device is in progress. All the study sites have begun conducting oral screening camps. The results of this study shall provide robust evidence for the diagnostic use of autofluorescence and TB staining in early oral cancer detection among patients with OPMD. The use of these noninvasive adjuncts by primary health care providers can significantly improve oral cancer screening in our country. The validation of risk-based stratification and management of patients with OPMD shall assist in the refinement of the national guidelines for these interventions. This study has been approved by the respective ethics committee of ICMR-National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research and the collaborating institutes. The findings of this study shall be disseminated through scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals as well as meetings with the concerned stakeholders at the district and state health departments.

This study aimed to characterize exposure to fungi, bacteria, and endotoxin in a historical museum where the staff reported airway symptoms. Air samples were collected during three separate workdays using personal and stationary samplers. Fungi and bacteria were quantified and identified using MALDI-TOF MS, and the total inflammatory potential was measured through Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production in a human cell line. The geometric mean of staff exposure was 5.9 × 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/m<sup>3</sup> fungi, 1.8 × 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/m<sup>3</sup> bacteria, and 7.93 EU/m<sup>3</sup> endotoxin. Staff reported symptoms of the airways, with immediate symptoms upon entering two departments, which exhibited elevated fungal concentrations compared to other departments. The most prevalent fungal species were <i>Aspergillus conicus, A. domesticus, A. pseudoglaucus</i>, <i>A. pseudogracilis</i>, and <i>Cladosporium</i> spp. Concentrations of bacteria were highest when staff were present and without dominance by any particular species. Staff exposure and stationary samples induced ROS production in a cell line, which correlated with concentrations of fungi, bacteria, and endotoxin. Fungi were detected on the museum artifacts, and concentrations of fungi and bacteria increased during handling of the artifacts. In conclusion, staff in the two departments where airway symptoms were reported were exposed to 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> to 7 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/m<sup>3</sup> of fungi, primarily <i>Aspergillus</i> spp.",

      "content": "Electrosurgery generates surgical smoke, which contains hazardous compounds. The concentration, composition, and size distribution of surgical smoke vary significantly with surgery type, duration, and number of times electrocautery is used. Exposure assessments have focused on characterizing occupational exposure to surgical smoke during human surgeries, but occupational exposure to surgical smoke during veterinary surgeries is largely unknown. Given the hazardous exposure concentrations identified in human surgical procedures, similar occupational exposures are expected in small animal surgeries. Thus, there is a critical need to evaluate occupational exposures among veterinarians conducting small animal surgeries and to evaluate potential exposure reduction systems. The objectives of the study are to quantify the particle number concentration and size distribution during canine limb amputation (CLA) surgery and to quantify the exposure reductions associated with a smoke evacuation system (SES). Exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP) during CLA was measured using a TSI NanoScan Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) Nanoparticle Sizer 3910 during surgeries with and without the SES. Particle number concentrations were 11 times higher compared to background concentrations during CLA surgeries. The particle number concentration was significantly reduced when using SES during surgery compared to surgeries without SES. The average total particle number concentration near the veterinarian's breathing zone was 25,141 particles/cm<sup>3</sup> for surgeries without SES and 7,643 particles/cm<sup>3</sup> when the SES was used during surgeries, which represents about a 70% reduction in exposure. CLA was associated with particle exposures similar to those seen in human surgeries.",

      "content": "An additional larger cohort of CrVI-exposed aerospace workers, including women, and with lower intensity exposures, was recently updated with a longer follow-up period and reconstructed cumulative exposure estimates. A risk assessment was conducted using a pooled analysis of individual-level dose-response information from three cohorts, including the aerospace workers, to generate lung cancer inhalation unit risk estimates (IURs). IURs are estimates of the upper-bound of lifetime increased cancer risk from continuous inhalation exposure to 1 µg/m<sup>3</sup> and are commonly used in quantitative risk assessment. Use of the pooled cohort broadens the range for dose-response analysis due to the comparatively low exposures to CrVI in the aerospace cohort; moreover, sex-specific risks could be expanded with the inclusion of female workers. Standardized logistic regression using person-year-specific weighted cumulative exposures was used to estimate the probability of lung cancer mortality, with varied weighting approaches. The primary model included male workers from all cohorts with a minimum of one year of CrVI exposure; secondary analyses examined the impacts of sex and short-term exposure. The best fit dose-response function was a Michaelis-Menten relationship. The IUR from the primary model was 0.01 (95%CI: 0.006-0.01) per µg/m<sup>3</sup>. Best estimates of the three IURs from secondary analyses, which removed the respiratory use adjustment factors, included females from the aerospace cohort and added workers with less than one year of exposure from the chromate production cohorts, were relatively consistent with the primary analyses, ranging from 0.008 to 0.03 per µg/m<sup>3</sup>. Use of this pooled IUR estimate allows for inclusion of a broader dose-response range and reduced uncertainty through use of a larger population, additional years of follow-up, and incorporation of broader geographical and cohort characteristics with improved relevancy to the general population.",

This enhancement is most notable when control rights are transferred, when acquiring SOEs possess high R&D investment but lower production efficiency, and in regions with less developed markets. The primary mechanism appears to be improved corporate governance through increased private shareholder involvement in strategic decision-making. These findings advance our understanding of how ownership differences influence innovation in M&As while providing practical guidance for SOE reform policies in China and similar emerging economies.",

Emerging therapeutic approaches, including neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies, are critically evaluated. Targeted therapy (eg, BRAF/MEK and KIT inhibitors) demonstrated comparable efficacy in advanced MM and CM. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors show promise in CM, their efficacy in MM is modest, with antiangiogenic-based combination therapies offering potential improvements. Preclinical and ongoing clinical trials underscore the need for personalized treatment strategies on the basis of molecular profiling. This review emphasizes the urgency for further research to address the unmet needs in MM management and improve patient outcomes.",

The growing understanding of physiologic age and frailty, as well as improvements in supportive care, has made this possible. Bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibodies are heralding a new age of treatment of MM with high response rates in patients with relapsed or refractory MM. With the impressive responses seen, these treatments are being studied in earlier lines of therapy and in combination with other therapies.

Skeletal muscle-related gene expression was evaluated by immunoblotting, and the effects of AET on mitochondrial function were assessed using immunoblotting and commercial kits. Additionally, JC-1 staining was employed to examine mitochondrial dysfunction and further confirm the underlying mechanisms. AET significantly improves cardiac function in MI mice and could mitigate skeletal muscle atrophy in these mice. Further analysis revealed that activation of the SIRT1/ PGC-1α pathway by AET enhances mitochondrial function in MI mice. Additionally, SIRT1 activation was shown to alleviate skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction induced by heart failure in vitro. AET can alleviate skeletal muscle atrophy induced by heart failure in mice through the SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway.",

It reveals m6A's regulatory role in the oncogenic MYC and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways. In addition, we discovered that T-ALL is highly dependent on the m6A reader heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC). HNRNPC is transcriptionally controlled by MYC and is an essential regulator of m6A-modified transcripts. Consequently, transcriptional silencing of HNRNPC profoundly impairs oncogenic pathways and critically diminishes leukemia cell growth. Additionally, the levels of the m6A demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) are significantly elevated in T-ALL cells compared to normal cells, and to other types of leukemia. Targeting FTO shows therapeutic potential in preclinical disease models and synergizes with clinically relevant therapeutics. Our findings underscore the integral role of RNA methylation in orchestrating cancer cell oncogene expression and metabolism and highlight promising novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of T-cell leukemia.",

Ethical implementation will require balancing privacy and transparency through community engagement. Future directions include using environmental surveillance to detect emerging zoonoses, fill gaps when clinical testing wanes, and inform public health actions. While logistical, regulatory, and ethical challenges remain, coordination across scientific and public health stakeholders can enable environmental monitoring to transform epidemic intelligence. This review summarizes recent developments in environmental surveillance systems and discusses how they can mitigate the introduction and spread of viruses in communities.",

The double-amplification strategies containing rolling circle amplification (RCA) and DNAzyme-assisted Pb<sup>2+</sup> cycling reaction were exquisitely designed and applied for upgrading the detection characteristics of the biosensor. The experimental findings demonstrated that the PEC signal was progressively recovered as the Pb<sup>2+</sup> concentration increased from 500 fM to 5 μM, and the detection limit was 166.7 fM under optimal conditions, thus endowing the biosensor with the benefits of strong specificity and high selectivity.

Loneliness was assessed using end-of-day diary surveys pre- and post-training. A total of 50 caregivers completed the training and pre- and post-training assessments (91%), and all who completed the post-training assessment reported they were satisfied or very satisfied with the program. A secondary aim was to examine whether the mobile health mindfulness training intervention reduced loneliness. A mixed effect linear model using end-of-day survey-sampled loneliness showed a non-significant decline in loneliness among participants in the mindfulness group (<i>p</i> = .27). Participants who used the breathing app demonstrated a significant decrease in loneliness (<i>p</i> = .00). The 14-day breathing training may have provided a more targeted approach to improving subjective loneliness in this population. Overall, these results demonstrate that older caregivers can use technology to improve experiences of loneliness.",

      "content": "The development of new adsorbents for water treatment often involves complex adsorption mechanisms, whose individual contributions are unclear, thereby limiting the understanding of adsorption driving forces, making it difficult to achieve precise design of adsorbents. Machine learning (ML) has been used to uncover the impacts of these mechanisms through feature engineering, but progress is limited by the data quality for training. Herein, we developed a universal ML strategy for precisely predicting the adsorption capacity of polymers for oxyanions and identifying the adsorption driving force based on the combination of experimental and published literature data. The adsorption mechanism was explored through classification of RDkit descriptors with different SHAP importance values, and electrostatic interaction was found to be the driving force in the oxyanion adsorption process, which was further verified by theoretical calculations, adsorption experiments, and effective targeted adsorbent design.",

To explore this further, we leveraged publicly available genetic data to conduct a Mendelian randomization phenome-wide association study (MR-PheWAS) of neutrophil traits and 14,983 outcomes. Genetic proxies for neutrophil count, granularity, and serum myeloperoxidase were linked to 145 outcomes. Higher neutrophil count was associated with lower body weight, reduced obesity risk, and increased vascular activation markers but not with atherosclerosis. Elevated neutrophil count was robustly linked to Alzheimer's disease and neutrophil granularity with gut microbiota abundance and dental pathology. Our findings reveal the diverse roles of neutrophils extending beyond pathogen defense and underscore the potential for MR-PheWAS in identifying novel neutrophil-related pathophysiology.",

      "content": "Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, serves as an inducer that strengthens plants and elicits defense responses to enhance resistance against pathogens. Currently, the antiviral mechanism of thiamine remains unclear. Here, we used maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) as a model to elucidate the antiviral mechanism of thiamine. We found that thiamine application improved maize resistance to the MCMV. Transcriptome sequencing indicated that MCMV infection influenced the expression of thiamine synthesis pathway-related genes. Besides, MCMV P31 interacted with the key thiamine synthesis factor, ZmTHIC in cytoplasm, and blocked ZmTHIC entering into chloroplast. Using the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) induced gene silencing system, we silenced <i>ZmTHIC</i> in maize, resulting in higher accumulation of MCMV compared to the control plants. LC-MS analysis revealed that both <i>ZmTHIC</i> silencing and MCMV infection reduced the thiamine content in maize. Thiamine treatment prior to MCMV infection enhanced plant defense responses by activating the MAPK pathway and promoting lignin synthesis in plant cell walls, ultimately inhibiting MCMV infection. Taking together, our results suggest that thiamine induced the synthesis of lignin and MAPK pathway to enhance the systemic immunity, promoting antiviral defense in maize. MCMV P31 hijacked ZmTHIC and prevented it from entering the chloroplasts, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of thiamine to dampen the synthesis of lignin and MAPK pathway to dampen the plant immunity.",

      "content": "Despite increasing recognition, diagnostic delays remain common, often prompting patients to seek information online. This systematic review evaluated the quality and readability of HS-related information across AI-generated content, search engine derived resources, and social media platforms. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar identified 17 studies published between 2017 and 2024 that assessed HS-related online content using validated scoring tools and/or physician evaluation. More than 50% of studies rated online HS materials as variable in quality, with 36.4% rating them as moderate. Readability assessments revealed that most resources exceeded the recommended 6th to 8th grade reading level, limiting accessibility for patients. Social media platforms, particularly TikTok and YouTube, featured highly engaging but frequently inaccurate or anecdotal content, with physician-generated materials receiving lower engagement than non-medical sources. These findings highlight the critical need for simplified, evidence-based online resources to improve health literacy and support informed decision-making in HS. The prevalence of misinformation, particularly regarding alternative treatments and pharmaceutical scepticism, underscores the urgency of enhanced patient education strategies. Future efforts should focus on AI-driven readability improvements, clinician engagement in digital education, and collaboration with social media platforms to ensure the availability of accessible, high-quality HS information.",

      "content": "We present an analytical framework for quantifying the effects of HIV-related stigma on the treatment cascade using biomarker data from a Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) in Tanzania. We first reviewed HIV-related stigma items from 15 PHIA surveys in sub-Saharan Africa. Using nationally representative data of 1,831 diagnosed and undiagnosed PLHIV aged 15 and older in Tanzania, we applied modified Poisson regression models to examine associations of stigma with the treatment cascade, adjusting for HIV knowledge and demographics. We identified 41 unique stigma-related items in 13 of the 15 PHIA surveys. In Tanzania, PLHIV who expressed any stigma driver (stigmatizing attitude, discriminatory attitude, or shame) were 27% less likely to know their HIV status (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 0.73; 95%CI [0.65-0.83], p < 0.001), while those expressing all three were almost never aware of their status (aPR < 0.01; 95%CI [0-0.01], p < 0.001). Stigma drivers were not significantly associated with ART use among diagnosed PLHIV or viral load suppression (VLS) among those on ART. Diagnosed PLHIV who felt the need to hide their status when seeking non-HIV healthcare were 9% less likely to be on ART (aPR 0.91; 95%CI [0.85-0.98], p = 0.013), and those on ART were 10% less likely to achieve VLS (aPR 0.90; 95%CI [0.81-0.99], p = 0.047). Stigma likely prevented many undiagnosed PLHIV in Tanzania from knowing their status. Fear of healthcare discrimination due to anticipated stigma undermines ART uptake among diagnosed PLHIV and viral suppression among those on ART. PHIA surveys have untapped potential to quantify the effects of HIV-related stigma and inform interventions to end HIV as a public health threat.",

However, ADMET analysis confirmed T-cadinol's drug-likeness, suggesting good bioavailability and minimal toxicity risks. Thus, molecular docking revealed high binding affinity, which was further validated through a 100 ns MD simulation and demonstrated stable interactions with low root mean square deviation (RMSD). Additionally, hydrogen bond analysis confirmed that T-cadinol maintained consistent interactions with key residues such as Thr-790 in EGFR, Arg-222 in ALB, and Arg-104 in IL-6, indicating strong binding stability.

In vivo, loss of PHD3 correlates with abrogation of the IFNS and activation of the disease-associated microglia signature, an increase in microglia proximity to Aß plaques and phagocytosis of both Aß and small plaques. PHD3 deficiency mitigated the Aß plaque-associated neuropathology and rescued behavioral deficits of an AD mouse model. Last, we demonstrate that microglial PHD3 overexpression in the absence of Aß pathology is sufficient to induce the IFNS and behavioral alterations. Together, our data strongly indicate that the inactivation of the PHD3-FOXO3 axis controls the microglial IFNS in a cell autonomous manner, improving AD outcome.",

They struggle to capture continuous-time dynamics and model complex systems, and suffer from substantial time and energy overheads due to physically separated storage and processing as well as frequent analog-digital (A/D) conversions. Here, we propose a memristive neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for digital twins. Our approach is intrinsically time-continuous using infinite-depth neural networks to model complex dynamics. Fully analog memristor arrays collocate storage and computation, addressing the von Neumann bottleneck and reducing A/D conversion requirements. We experimentally validate our solver on digital twins of HP variable-resistor model and Lorenz96 dynamics, demonstrating a 166.5-fold/369.3-fold speedup and a 499.0-fold/673.9-fold improvement in energy efficiency, respectively. This work paves the way to future digital twins for Industry 4.0.",

GATA2<sup>low</sup> murine progenitors are hypersensitive to inflammatory mediators. We discovered that the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 conferred transcriptional activation in GATA2<sup>low</sup> progenitors in response to Interferon-γ and Toll-Like Receptor 1/2 agonists. In a locus-specific manner, inflammation reconfigured genome activity by promoting PU.1 recruitment to chromatin or tuning activity of PU.1-preoccupied chromatin. The recruitment mechanism disproportionately required IKKβ activity. Inflammation-activated genes were enriched in motifs for RUNX factors that cooperate with GATA factors. Contrasting with the GATA2-RUNX1 cooperativity paradigm, GATA2 suppressed and RUNX1 promoted PU.1 mechanisms to endow the progenitor genome with inflammation-sensing capacity.",

Using benzoylecgonine (a nonvolatile cocaine metabolite) as a sewage tracer, we find that wastewater compounds-including a mixture of illicit drugs, drug metabolites, and chemicals from tires and personal care products-become aerosolized and are detectable in both water and air.

This paper reviews MR principles, assumptions, and specific challenges in ID. We highlight examples violating key assumptions, noting that MR studies using infection as an exposure are particularly prone to bias compared to using infection as an outcome. We discuss the future of MR in ID, emphasizing appropriate application to address causal questions unanswerable by other methods and capitalize on emerging opportunities where MR can provide unique insights.",

Whereas the binding domains differed in efficacy in vitro, the spacer region shaped the kinetics of the CAR T cells in vivo. When used in a CRC liver xenograft model, CDH17 CAR T cells efficiently suppressed tumor growth upon either systemic or locoregional administration. However, when tested in mice reconstituted with a human immune system, CAR T cells injected locally caused a particularly harsh cytokine release syndrome. Confocal microscopy revealed that CDH17 is exposed on the entire surface of tumor cells, whereas its expression in healthy colon is restricted to lateral junctions between epithelial cells. Accordingly, CDH17 CAR T cells showed dose-dependent cytokine release in response to CRC tissue slices while displaying no reaction against healthy colon tissue samples. Overall, these findings support systemic delivery of CDH17 CAR T cells as a safe and effective approach to treat CRC liver metastases and pave the way for a phase 1/2 clinical trial.",

      "content": "However, the development of second primary malignancies (SPMs) indicates a poor survival prognosis for FL patients, and large-scale studies in this field remain limited. This study investigates the prognostic factors for FL patients in the rituximab era, as well as the clinical characteristics, risk factors, and prognosis for patients who developed SPMs. From 2000 to 2020, a total of 33,104 patients with pathologically confirmed FL were identified within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Competing-risk regression analysis was used to assess prognostic factors for lymphoma-specific survival (LSS), risk factors for developing SPMs, and prognosis in FL patients. Multivariate analysis identified age ≥ 40 years, Black race, unmarried status, non-urban residence, nodal lymphoma presentation, Grade 3 histology, advanced Ann Arbor stage, and B symptoms as independent adverse prognostic factors for both overall survival (OS) and LSS. Chemotherapy as initial treatment was associated with inferior LSS in FL patients. Protective factors for OS and LSS included female sex, higher income, diagnosis post-2005, diagnosis-to-treatment intervals >1 month, and receipt of radiotherapy or surgery. SPMs correlated with reduced LSS risk in FL patients. Elevated SPM incidence among patients aged>40years, and non-Hispanic ethnicity, while reduced SPM risks were observed in females, unmarried patients, those receiving non-radiotherapy initial treatment, Grade 3 cases, and patients diagnosed during 2015-2019. Notably, FL patients aged >60 years, unmarried, and those diagnosed post-2010 demonstrated heightened OS risk following SPM development. Conversely, initial radiotherapy conferred protective effects against both OS and LSS in patients with SPMs. In this study, we conducted a large, population-based analysis across the United States to identify risk factors for the development of SPMs and to delineate prognostic indicators for FL patients in the context of rituximab therapy, along with the clinical characteristics, risk factors, and prognostic features associated with SPMs. These findings have translational implications for risk-adapted surveillance. Future studies should validate predictive models across diverse healthcare settings, elucidate molecular mechanisms of SPM pathogenesis in FL, and evaluate targeted screening interventions through prospective trials.",

This Review explores such feedback mechanisms, traces the evolution of physically intelligent robots, outlines strategies for embedding API in soft robots under diverse environments, and further discusses challenges and future directions beyond simple locomotion.",

      "content": "Few studies have been dedicated to examining the impact of large-scale rural labor migration (RLM) on HWSW in rural China. Based on a nationwide sample including 6849 rural residents, this paper investigates the relationship between RLM and rural residents' HWSW. The generalized propensity score (GPS) method and the instrumental variable (IV) approach are used to account for potential selection bias and endogenous problems. The results show that RLM inhibits rural residents' HWSW. Specifically, with every 1% increase in RLM, the likelihood of rural residents' HWSW will decrease by 3.5%. This effect remains significant after a series of robustness checks. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the negative impact of RLM on HWSW is larger for rural residents who live in Midwest China, with low education and less income. Further mechanism analysis shows that RLM reduces rural residents' HWSW by decreasing their social capital, undermining their rural community administration, and diminishing their village's collective economic income.",

The studies included were conducted in Brazil (<i>n</i> = 2), China (<i>n</i> = 5), India (<i>n</i> = 1), Iran (<i>n</i> = 1), Malaysia (<i>n</i> = 1) and South Africa (<i>n</i> = 1) between 2012 and 2024. An overarching theme was identified: We are an island: underdeveloped dementia care within the LTC settings in LMICs, and the following categories identified as (1) the development of care provided for people living with dementia within care home settings is in its infancy; (2) the positive and effective coping strategies that may help embrace a brighter future of dementia care; (3) the deficiencies in caregiving approaches that contributed to poor-quality care for people living with dementia. <b>Conclusions:</b> The development of dementia care services within LTC in LMICs is still in its early stages. The main concern is the lack of available support and training for care staff and their insufficient dementia knowledge and care competencies. We hope that this review will help to increase attention to this significant issue of long-term institutional care for people with dementia in LMICs and that further research could investigate and enhance potential improvements in the practical implementation of long-term residential dementia care.",

The most time-consuming part of Shamir's attack is to recover the critical intermediate parameters by solving an integer programming problem with a fixed number of variables, whose worst-case complexity is exponential of the number of variables. In this paper, we present an improved algorithm to analyze the basic Merkle-Hellman public key cryptosystem. The main idea is to recover a partial super-increasing sequence as equivalent private key, which is the main difference from Shamir's. More precisely, we first obtain a super-increasing sequence by invoking the LLL algorithm on a special lattice with a small dimension. We can recover most part of the plaintext from the tail by solving the super-increasing knapsack problem. Finally, we get the first part of plaintext by solving a size-reduced knapsack problem. Experimental data shows that one can recover the whole plaintext in less than 1 second on a laptop for the typical parameters of the Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem, whose time complexity is reduced by a polynomial level compared with Shamir's algorithm.",

In this study, we analyzed tissue RNA-seq data and clinical information of healthy individuals and MASLD patients from multiple datasets, the key genes and pathways involved in the occurrence and progression of MASLD, MASH, and fibrosis were screened respectively. Our findings reveal that the development of MASLD, MASH and fibrosis is associated with lipid metabolism processes. Based on the RNA expression profiles of identified hub genes, we established three alternative diagnostic models for MASLD, MASH, and fibrosis. These models demonstrated excellent performance in the diagnosis of MASLD, MASH, and fibrosis, with AUC values exceeding 0.9, implicating its potential clinical values in disease diagnosis.",

Analysis steps of SNT were supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners. As SNT was a new approach, this study used semi-structured interviews to understand the perspectives and experiences of personnel from five NMPs (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, and Togo) that undertook SNT between 2019 and 2023. Participants reported that SNT outputs were used to inform national strategic plans and prioritized plans, that the process incentivized improvements in data collection and data quality, and that NMPs were strongly motivated to grow their capacity to conduct more steps of the SNT analysis process internally. Major challenges included the lack of resources available to implement the full strategic plans as well as challenges with data quality and alignment of stakeholders. Participants reported a moderate to strong sense of ownership over the process and were eager to extend, adapt, and reuse the SNT process in the future. Among countries supported by WHO, SNT was well-accepted and allowed NMPs to successfully use evidence to inform their decision-making, advocate for themselves, and mobilize resources.",

This paper models the impact of these concurrent events on the global food market, using the Russian-Ukrainian war and the extreme heatwaves of summer 2022 as a case study. The model considers four war scenarios: the start of the invasion, the peak of the war, Ukraine's resistance, sanctions against Russia, and refugee crises in Europe. Using data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Statista, WITS, and Acclimate production value losses, the results show that the agricultural sectors of southern European countries such as France, Italy, and Spain were the most affected by the extreme events, although the direct impact of refugees was smaller compared to their northern counterparts. Strict sanctions against Russia coupled with Ukraine's resistance will benefit EU food markets, but at the same time the agricultural sectors of smaller countries and weaker economies, particularly those of Russia's allies, will be highly vulnerable. This study suggests that when developing and adopting conflict resolution strategies, their impact on weak economies should not be overlooked. An example of this policy recommendation is the continuous renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative to stabilize global food prices.",

Data were collected through self-reported questionnaires and medical records, with viral load data linked to Public Health Ontario Laboratories (PHOL). Logistic regression was used to examine the outcomes of optimal ART adherence and viral load suppression, and linear regression was used for quality of life (mental and physical) outcomes. In 2022, 1930 participants accessed HIV care in the OCS. Among them, 19.0% received virtual care, 45.6% received in-person care, and 34.3% received care through virtual and in-person modalities. The median age of the participants was 55 years (IQR: 45-62). In the multivariable logistic regression model, virtual care was associated with an increased likelihood of optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.70) and an increased likelihood of achieving viral load suppression (AOR 1.67, 95% CI:1.03, 2.63). Moreover, combined virtual and in-person care is associated with an improved mental quality of life compared to in-person care (Adjusted Mean difference (MD) - 0.960, 95% CI: 0.05, 1.87). This study suggests virtual care is positively associated with adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and viral suppression within this context. However, future research is necessary to establish causality and to assess the long-term effects of virtual care.",

The aim of the study was to examine the level, distribution, and changes in mental well-being over time in a Swedish adolescent population. Current study is based on four waves (2014-2017-2020-2023) of a cross-sectional student survey (N = 16288, Mage = 16.23). The outcome was measured with the Mental Health Continuum Short Form. Ten explanatory factors were chosen to examine differences in mental well-being in the study population: Grade, Sex, Sexual orientation, Socioeconomic status, Country of birth, Visual, Hearing or Mobility impairment, Specific learning disorder and Neurodevelopmental disorder. Differences in mental well-being between groups as well as temporal trends were examined and evaluated through statistical testing and hierarchical multiple linear regressions modeling. Girls, non-heterosexual adolescents, and adolescents with low socioeconomic status or impairments have lower levels of mental well-being than boys, heterosexual adolescents, and adolescents with higher socioeconomic status or without impairments, respectively. A deterioration in mental well-being is seen over time for several groups; however, results of the multivariable analysis indicates that the deterioration is mainly an effect of sex and the significant decline in mental well-being seen among girls. The most significant factor for explaining the variation in mental well-being in this study is socioeconomic status. This study elucidates temporal changes and differences in levels of mental well-being between social groups in the adolescent population. The overall differences are small, but their potential implications for public health warrant careful consideration since they concern a significant part of the population. The results underscore the imperative of promoting mental well-being in adolescents, particularly among vulnerable groups.",

      "content": "This study was conducted to enhance conventional epidemiological surveillance by implementing city-wide wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The research aimed to develop a quantitative model for estimating infection rates and to compare these predictions with clinical case data. Furthermore, this wastewater surveillance was utilized as an early warning system for potential COVID-19 outbreaks during a large international event, the Chengdu 2023 FISU Games. This study employed wastewater based epidemiology (WBE), utilizing samples collected twice a week from nine wastewater treatment plants that serve 66.1% of Chengdu's residents, totaling 15.2 million people. The samples were collected between January 18, 2023, and June 15, 2023, and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A model employed back-calculation of SARS-CoV-2 infections by integrating wastewater viral load measurements with human fecal and urinary shedding rates, as well as population size estimates derived from NH4-N concentrations, utilizing Monte Carlo simulations to quantify uncertainty. The model's predictions compared with the number of registered cases identified by the Nucleic Acid Testing Platform of Chengdu during the same period. Additionally, we conducted sampling from two manholes in the wastewater pipeline, which encompassed all residents of the Chengdu 2023 FISU World University Games village, and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We also gathered data on COVID-19 cases from the symptom monitoring system between July 20 and August 11. From the third week to the twenty-fourth week of 2023, the weekly median concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fluctuated, starting at 16.94 copies/ml in the third week, decreasing to 1.62 copies/ml by the fifteenth week, then gradually rising to a peak of 41.27 copies/ml in the twentieth week, before ultimately declining to 8.74 copies/ml by the twenty-fourth week. During this period, the number of weekly new cases exhibited a similar trend, and the results indicated a significant correlation between the viral concentration and the number of weekly new cases (spearman's r = 0.93, P < 0.001). The quantitative wastewater surveillance model estimated that approximately 2,258,245 individuals (P5-P95: 847,869 - 3,928,127) potentially contracted COVID-19 during the epidemic wave from March 4th to June 15th, which is roughly 33 times the number of registered cases (68,190 cases) reported on the Nucleic Acid Testing Platform. Furthermore, the infection rates of SARS-CoV-2, as estimated by the model, ranged from 0.012% (P5-P95: 0.004% - 0.020%) at the lowest baseline to 3.27% (P5-P95: 1.23% - 5.69%) at the peak of the epidemic, with 15.1% (P5-P95: 5.65% - 26.2%) of individuals infected during the epidemic wave between March 4th and June 15th. Additionally, we did not observe any COVID-19 outbreaks or cluster infections at the Chengdu 2023 FISU World University Games village, and there was no significant difference in the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in athletes before and after check-in at the village.",

      "content": "This analytical cross-sectional study included 199 type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) patients from the Jahrom city endocrinology clinic. Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured, and their microvascular complications (microalbuminuria, retinopathy, neuropathy, macroalbuminuria) and glycemic control (HbA1C) were measured and confirmed according to ADA guidelines and endocrinologist supervision. All analysis were done with SPSS software. The study enrolled 199 type 2 diabetic patients with a mean age of 56.79 ± 10.8 years, of which 63.3% were female and 57.3% had hypertension. The mean BMI was 28.91 kg/m², and 29.1% of participants had vitamin D deficiency. The prevalence of microvascular complications was 25.6% for retinopathy, 14.1% for neuropathy, and 40% for nephropathy. Vitamin D deficiency was notably higher among patients with retinopathy (37.25%), neuropathy (50%), and macroalbuminuria (56.25%). Patients with neuropathy and retinopathy had significantly lesser serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to patients without these complications. There was a slight inverse correlation between vitamin D levels and both the urine albumin creatinine ratio (r = -0.175, p = 0.018) and HbA1C (r = -0.19, p = 0.007). Although the link between vitamin D levels and retinopathy was not statistically significant (η = 0.903, p = 0.68), the alteration in vitamin D levels was suggestively linked with neuropathy (η = 0.975, p < 0.001). Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among type 2 diabetic patients and is related to a higher occurrence of microvascular complications and poorer glycemic control. These findings underscore the potential importance of managing vitamin D levels in reducing complications and improving diabetes outcomes. Future studies should investigate whether oral vitamin D supplements consumption can improve glycemic control and reduce microvascular complications in these patients.",

      "content": "Due to increased population, disease burden, and patient awareness, healthcare demand is rising, putting pressure on funding and quality assurance. The Nigerian healthcare financing and its impacts are complex; this study gives insights into the trends. This questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey (conducted from June to August 2023) and 2010-2023 health budget analysis examined healthcare finance patterns and user attitudes (utilisation, preference and quality perceptions) in Nigeria. Data from government health budgets and a stratified random sample of 2,212 from nine states, obtained from the socioculturally diverse 237 million population, were analysed with a focus on trends, proportions, frequency distributions, and tests of association. Results show that the average rating of healthcare experiences did not vary significantly over the last decade. Healthcare system quality was rated mainly poor or very poor; structure (74.09%), services (61.66%), and cost (60.89%). While 87.36% used government healthcare facilities, 85.00% paid out-of-pocket, and 72.60% of them were dissatisfied with the value for money. Despite a preference for government facilities (71.43%), respondents cited high costs (62.75%), poor funding (85.65%), inadequate staffing (90.73%), and lack of essential medicines (88.47%) as major challenges. The budget analysis reveals an average government healthcare fund allocation of $7.12 compared with an estimated expenditure of $82.75 per person annually. Nigeria allocates only an average of 0.37% of GDP and 4.61% of the national budget to healthcare, comprising a maximum of 13.56% of total health expenditure. This study emphasises the urgent need for policy reforms and implementations to improve Nigeria's healthcare financing and service quality. Targeted interventions are essential to address systemic challenges and meet population needs while aligning with international health services and best standards.",

In this study, we aimed to examine the relationship between oral function and low body weight as well as the ability to perform ADLs in older patients with HF. To this end, we retrospectively examined patients with HF aged 75 years or older who had undergone oral function assessments. We examined various factors including age, sex, BMI, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), Oral Health Assessment Tool-Japanese version (OHAT-J) scores, Barthel Index (BI) scores, and length of hospital stay. Patients were categorized into two groups based on their OHAT-J scores (OHAT-J ≤ 2 or OHAT-J ≥ 3), and their characteristics, including individual survey items, were compared. Additional correlation analyses were performed for BI at discharge. We found a negative correlation between the total OHAT-J score and BI at discharge. Specifically, lower BIs at discharge were observed in the group with poor scores for the items \"lips,\" \"saliva,\" and \"dentures.\" Oral dysfunction was associated with decreased ability to perform ADLs at discharge in older patients with HF. Thus, interdisciplinary interventions targeting oral health may improve the prognosis of patients with HF.",
