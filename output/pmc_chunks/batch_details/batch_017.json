Descriptive statistics were compared using t-test and Chi-square test. Intergroup comparisons of change in NRS scores to various stimuli were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. The baseline comparison of NRS scores to air, water and tactile stimuli did not reveal any statistically significant differences. The change in NRS scores post air blast, 1 week and 1 month, after the treatment for sensitivity, was observed to be significantly higher in the Gluma group compared to self-etching adhesive (P = 0.001).

      "content": "This retrospective study included adult patients with TBI and intracranial injury treated at a level-1 trauma hospital. The primary exposure was on serum magnesium levels within 6 hour of emergency department admission. Study outcomes included 6-month mortality and disability, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (scores 1-3). Multilevel multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between serum magnesium levels and study outcomes, with stratified analysis employed to investigate potential variations based on age groups. Low magnesium levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of 6-month disability (Odds ratio (OR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-2.68) and 6-month mortality (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.03-2.99). This association remained significant exclusively among younger patients, with ORs of 2.70 (95% CI: 1.21-5.14) for 6-month disability and 2.33 (95%, CI: 1.11-4.49) for 6-month mortality when stratified by age. Low serum magnesium levels are associated with poorer long-term outcomes in patients with TBI, and this effect is especially pronounced in younger adults (18-64 years). Specifically, younger patients exhibiting hypomagnesemia demonstrated a higher incidence of 6-month disability and mortality. These findings suggest a need to identify the causative links and explore whether correcting serum magnesium levels will improve TBI prognosis across different age groups.",

      "content": "The current study aims to investigate the role of DDX17 in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration and vascular intimal hyperplasia. DDX17 expression was upregulated in injured mouse arteries and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-treated VSMCs. An adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vector carrying Ddx17 short hairpin RNA (shDdx17) was used to silence DDX17 expression in vivo. DDX17 silencing significantly ameliorated injury-induced mouse vascular intimal hyperplasia. In vitro, the recombinant lentivirus carrying Ddx17 shRNA (Len-Ddx17i) was used to inhibition DDX17 expression in VSMCs. DDX17 deficiency inhibited PDGF-BB-induced phenotypic switching of VSMCs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that DDX17 expression is closely related to glucose metabolism- and oxidative stress-associated pathways. Next, we found that glycolysis and oxidative stress were both attenuated by DDX17 ablation in VSMCs. Mechanically, reduced ras homolog enriched in brain (RHEB) expression and decreased mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity were observed after silencing of DDX17 in PDGF-BB-challenged VSMCs. Upregulating RHEB expression or elevating mTORC1 activity abolished the inhibitory effects of DDX17 silencing on PDGF-BB-induced glycolysis, oxidative stress, proliferation, and migration in VSMCs. Furthermore, the decreased mTORC1 activity induced by DDX17 deficiency was also reversed by RHEB overexpression. In conclusion, DDX17 silencing attenuates VSMC proliferation and migration by inhibiting RHEB/mTORC1-mediated glycolysis and oxidative stress, thus suppressing vascular intimal hyperplasia.",

      "content": "Solar-driven conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into high-value cyclic carbonates is considered an ideal carbon emission reduction strategy but synchronously faces the challenges of a low reaction rate and an unclear catalytic mechanism. Herein, oxygen vacancy-rich Bi<sub>4</sub>NbO<sub>8</sub>Cl (BNOC-OVs) are fabricated as CO<sub>2</sub> cycloaddition photocatalysts via a facile calcination strategy in a CO atmosphere. The introduction of OVs creates a high density of lattice disorder defects, which offers abundant Lewis acidic-basic active sites to efficiently drive the cycloaddition reaction. Crucially, both experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) computations demonstrate that OVs enhance the adsorption energies of substrate molecules and reduce the catalytic reaction barriers via regulating surface properties and electronic structure. As a result, BNOC-OVs2 exhibits an outstanding photocatalytic performance for the cycloaddition reaction of CO<sub>2</sub> and 1,2-epoxybutane, with a 1,2-butylene carbonate formation rate of 9224.5 μmol·g<sup>-1</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup>, much superior to other bismuth-based photocatalysts and a state-of-the-art catalyst system with the same substrates. For the first time, the solar to chemical (STC) conversion efficiency for photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> cycloaddition reaction is determined, which is up to 0.6%.",

      "content": "Recently, ancient DNA studies on gray wolves from different regions of the Eurasian continent have achieved significant breakthroughs, providing important clues about the dog origins. As one of the potential origin areas for dogs, East Asia has seen some research on ancient dogs; however, reports related to gray wolves remain limited. In this study, we sequenced seven new mitogenomes of ancient gray wolves from Northern China, integrating them with 497 ancient and modern canid mitogenomes from published data. Our results reveal the following: (1) East Asian gray wolves have maintained high genetic diversity from ancient times to the present; (2) multiple haplogroup A gray wolves from Northern China support the hypothesis that Northeastern Eurasia is a core region for dog origins; (3) a deep gray wolf lineage in East Asia has been identified in this study; (4) different mitogenomes concentrated at the Jinchankou site indicate that admixture may have frequently occurred in the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. These findings enhance our understanding of the maternal genetic history of gray wolves in East Asia.",

      "content": "Attention to plastic-related policies, global treaties, and initiatives assessing industrial sustainability are growing, and thus there is an urgent need for scientific data on the life cycle of BPs in soils to determine their viability as a truly sustainable alternative. BPs enter soil through agricultural applications, waste disposal, and landfills, undergoing complex degradation processes influenced by soil properties, environmental conditions, and polymer characteristics. However, the release of degradation by-products, including potential toxins and microplastics, raises concerns about soil health and plant growth. Furthermore, discrepancies in biodegradability claims and the lack of standardized assessment methods hinder the reliable evaluation of BP sustainability. To ensure the environmental viability of BPs, rigorous long-term studies and standardized testing protocols are necessary to validate their degradation, <i>in situ</i>, under environmentally relevant soil conditions. Without robust scientific evidence demonstrating the safe and effective degradation of BPs in soils, the expansion of their production and investment in these materials may be limited. This review highlights the urgent necessity for integrated approaches to support effective BP assessment, to bridge scientific research, industrial deployment, and policy frameworks, which are beneficial for mitigating potential unintended environmental consequences and achieving the relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",

Traditional methods can fail to capture the complexity of the neonatal respiratory microbiota, thereby obscuring its role in disease progression. We describe a novel approach that combines high-throughput sequencing with droplet-based microfluidic cultivation to investigate microbiome shifts in neonates with pneumonia. Using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing of 71 pneumonia cases and 49 controls, we identified 1009 genera, including 930 low-abundance taxa, which showed significant compositional differences between groups. Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size analysis identified key pneumonia-associated genera, such as Streptococcus, Rothia, and Corynebacterium. Droplet-based cultivation recovered 299 strains from 94 taxa, including rare species and ESKAPE pathogens, thereby supporting targeted antimicrobial management. Host-pathogen interaction assays showed that Rothia and Corynebacterium induced inflammation in lung epithelial cells, likely via dysregulation of the PI3K-Akt pathway. Integrating these marker taxa with clinical factors, such as gestational age and delivery type, offers the potential for precise diagnosis and treatment.",

Ternary and photoactive DNA architectures were prepared with these C-nucleosides to analyze the CPD formation quantitatively. The dimethoxy-substituted thioxanthone as a photosensitizer has a high triplet energy (288 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>). We observed the CPD formation over up to 6 A-T pairs in DNA, and the distance dependence is characterized by a low <i>β</i>-value of 0.02 Å<sup>-1</sup>, indicating energy hopping over the A-T pairs. The triplet energy of the chloro-and methoxy-modified photosensitizer is low (273 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) and only slightly above the threshold for DNA photosensitization set by the triplet energy of T in DNA (267 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>). Here, only low amounts of CPDs were obtained because the energy difference compared to T is very small. These results show clearly that the triplet energy of the photosensitizer incorporated into the DNA is decisive for not only whether CPDs can be induced at all but also how much CPDs are formed; the higher the triplet energy of the photosensitizer, the more CPDs are formed.",

Using this method, the positron affinities and positron binding features of water clusters up to hexamers are investigated. The present CPP calculations revealed reasonable size-dependence on positron binding energies and conformer-dependent properties for each cluster size for these water clusters. The bound positrons are also trapped internally within cavities of the three-dimensional water clusters, similar to the behavior of bound excess electrons in water cluster anions. However, since the positronic binding energies are smaller than the electronic binding energies in water cluster anions, the bound positrons exhibit delocalized features extending into the electronegative oxygen atoms of the water molecules acting as the multiple hydrogen donor. Such behavior differs from the water cluster anions, resulting in isomeric conformational dependence.",

      "content": "Clinical significance of SREBP1 was assessed in a PDAC cohort from China and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts. The in vitro mechanisms that SREBP1 regulated programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) were investigated using immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, Western blotting, luciferase assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation. In vivo studies using PDAC-bearing mice, humanized patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models, and autochthonous model of mutation (GEMM-KTC) evaluated the efficacy and mechanisms of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) antibodies and lipid inhibitors. Patients responding to anti-PD-1 therapy exhibited lower serum lipid levels than non-responders. Targeting SREBP1 disrupted lipid metabolism, decelerated tumor growth, and boosted the efficacy of immunotherapy for PDAC. Mechanistically, SREBP1 directly bound the PD-L1 promoter, suppressing its transcription. Meanwhile, PCSK9, a direct transcriptional target of SREBP1, modulated PD-L1 levels via lysosomal degradation. Consequently, the combination of PCSK9-neutralizing antibodies with PD-1 monotherapy showed a robust antitumor effect in both humanized PDX and GEMM-KTC models. The SREBP1-PCSK9 axis-mediated lipid metabolism is crucial for triggering immune evasion and resistance to anti-PD-1. Targeting the SREBP1-PCSK9 axis could potentially reverse PDAC's resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy.",

These pressure-responsive adjustments collectively optimize the donor-acceptor charge transfer efficiency while promoting radiative decay pathways. Notably, the unique molecular packing architecture of cocrystals enables precise manipulation of intermolecular interactions under compression, establishing a design principle fundamentally distinct from that of single-component systems. These findings establish a new design strategy for pressure-enhanced luminescence based on the rational control of intermolecular interactions in cocrystal systems, offering a promising route to overcome the pressure-induced quenching observed in conventional materials.",

      "content": "However, the characteristics of these cancers remain poorly understood. We studied the differences in clinical characteristics and endoscopic procedures between missed and detected cancers. Newly diagnosed laryngopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas identified during esophagogastroduodenoscopy at our hospital between January 2016 and December 2020 were analyzed. A total of 179 lesions were categorized into two groups: missed (n = 74) and detected (n = 105). Missed cancer was defined as a lesion identified within 18 months of preceding esophagogastroduodenoscopy at our hospital, while detected cancer was defined as a lesion not included in the missed group. The miss rate of laryngopharyngeal cancers on esophagogastroduodenoscopy was 41.3%. Multivariate analysis showed that the non-use rate of pethidine hydrochloride (odds ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval 2.0-8.6, p < 0.01), ratio of white-light imaging ≥ narrow-band imaging through observation of laryngopharynx (odds ratio 31.8, 95% confidence interval 3.9-258.0, p < 0.01), and number of \"comprehensiveness of laryngopharyngeal observation\" negatives (odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-5.4, p = 0.01) were significantly larger in the missed group. Univariate analysis showed that the number of tumors located on the epiglottis (p = 0.02) was significantly larger in the missed group. This study highlights the importance of precisely observing the laryngopharynx, facilitated by the use of pethidine hydrochloride and narrow-band imaging. In addition, epiglottic lesions are frequently missed. Comprehensive observation of the laryngopharynx using narrow-band imaging and premedication may reduce the frequency of missed cancers.",

      "content": "Covariate missingness is a prevalent issue in pharmacometrics modeling. Incorrect handling of missing covariates can lead to biased parameter estimates, adversely affecting clinical practice and drug development dosing decisions. Single imputation is usually favored by pharmacometricians for its simplicity, but it ignores the uncertainty about imputed values, potentially leading to biased estimates and standard errors. Multiple imputation, in contrast, generates multiple plausible values from a predictive distribution, addressing this uncertainty and thus is a preferable approach over single imputation to handle covariate missingness. Yet, its application in pharmacometrics remains limited due to perceived complexity. To address this, we developed a multiple imputation workflow specifically tailored for pharmacometricians, encouraging wider adoption of this more reliable method in pharmacometrics modeling. We compared single imputation and multiple imputation in estimating covariate effects using a publicly available dataset on warfarin pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. A one-compartment population pharmacokinetic model with baseline body weight as the only covariate was used to describe the warfarin pharmacokinetics.",

A total of 35 patients with PSP and 28 patients with PD were recruited. Magnetic susceptibility and area of the STN were measured by QSM. Axial and coronal scans were acquired to measure the STN magnetic susceptibility and area. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy for differentiating PSP from PD. In the axial scan group, STN susceptibility was significantly higher in PSP than PD (p = 0.047), with no difference in the coronal scan group (p = 0.066). PSP patients had a smaller STN area than PD in both axial (p < 0.001) and coronal (p = 0.002) scan groups. The combination of these metrics showed high diagnostic accuracy (Axial, AUC = 0.87; Coronal, AUC = 1.00) and excellent performance (AUC = 0.98) in cases within 3 years of onset. A combination of magnetic susceptibility and area of the STN measured by QSM can be used to discriminate PSP from PD, even at early stages.",

In this study, anonymous surveys were distributed to hand surgeons to understand how patient 'reliability' is defined and how it alters treatment decisions. Participants rated the importance of patient factors in assessing reliability, then completed fictional clinical vignettes detailing histories of patients undergoing elective surgery. Suspected substance usage and history of mental illness were rated as important factors in determining reliability, while gender and race were rated as not important. Physicians were significantly less likely to recommend surgery and exhibited less confidence in their recommendations when presented with a patient with a history of mental illness (<i>p</i> < 0.001) or suspected substance usage (<i>p</i> = 0.003). These findings suggest that while race and gender may not explicitly impact surgical decision-making, biases related to mental illness and substance use do affect treatment decisions and confidence levels. Recognizing these biases is critical for ensuring equitable care, and future efforts should explore strategies to mitigate their impact on surgical recommendations.",

Auxin response factor MdARF2 exhibits evolutionary conservation and negatively regulates malate accumulation through analysis of high-acid and low-acid orthogonal/reciprocal progenies derived from 'Gala' and 'Mato 1' apple varieties.",

A total of 394 patients who underwent lung transplantation at an academic center between February 2020 and June 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinicodemographic and swallowing data were collected. Univariable and multivariable regression were used in the analysis. Postoperatively, 392 patients (99.4%) underwent Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (96.7%) or Modified Barium Swallow Study (3.3%). Of these, 222 (56.6%) demonstrated unsafe swallowing, as defined by penetration without clearance alone (n = 110), aspiration alone (n = 14), or both (n = 98). Aspiration was silent and undiagnosed on clinical swallowing exam in 54.5%. Aspiration pneumonia occurred in 7.2% of patients with OPD compared to 1.8% in the non-OPD group (p = 0.013). Among discharged patients, 24.7% required a modified diet. Significant predictors of posttransplant OPD in univariable analysis included male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55), intubation duration (OR = 1.19), number of intubations (OR = 1.60), need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR = 2.12), tracheostomy (OR = 2.45), duration of NPO status (OR = 1.04), and abnormal vocal fold (VF) mobility (OR = 2.48). Male sex (OR = 2.34), length of intubation (OR = 1.14), and abnormal VF mobility (OR = 2.64) remained independent predictors on multivariable analysis. The high incidence of OPD and OPD with silent aspiration after lung transplantation emphasizes the need for pre- and postoperative instrumental swallowing evaluation. Future research should aim to characterize the swallowing impairment in this population and its impact on patient morbidity, lung function, and transplant success.",

This review critically examines the relationship between oral health and IE, exploring pathophysiological mechanisms, risk factors, and the evolving epidemiology of the disease. The discussion includes diagnostic challenges, particularly in culture-negative cases, and the emerging role of advanced imaging and molecular diagnostics in improving early detection. A central focus is placed on preventive strategies, highlighting the debate surrounding antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) in high-risk individuals and the potential role of periodontal therapy in reducing systemic inflammation and transient bacteremia. The review also addresses the growing concern of antimicrobial resistance and the necessity of balancing AP recommendations with antimicrobial stewardship. Additionally, this review identifies critical research gaps, including the need for longitudinal studies on the impact of oral health interventions on IE incidence and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between dental and medical professionals in optimizing patient care. By synthesizing current guidelines and emerging evidence, this review underscores the necessity of an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to mitigate the burden of IE and establish oral health as a key pillar of infection prevention.",

      "content": "We investigated the effects of landscape, management and community drivers on the temporal carabid biomass stability and its mean in agricultural landscapes. The dataset was composed of carabids collected in 57 arable agroecosystems from three areas in France excluding pastures and managed under organic, conservation or conventional farming. Data also included local- and landscape-level management descriptors. Through a piecewise structural equation modelling approach, we tested the effects of landscape- and field-level management intensity and variability, richness and compositional carabid community metrics such as mean α-richness, standard deviation α-richness, β-diversity and asynchrony on carabid biomass stability and mean value. The temporal stability of the carabid biomass increased as temporal β-diversity of the carabid community decreased and asynchrony among species increased. Furthermore, β-diversity decreased and asynchrony increased with the community's mean α-richness. At the landscape level, diversifying crop phenology and reducing the proportion of cropland appear to be the most efficient way to support carabid biomass stability. The effect of α-richness on carabid biomass stability tends to be modulated by species composition. However, this study underscores the need to investigate the relative effects of temporal β-diversity and asynchrony on the stabilisation of ecosystem functioning in real ecosystems, as the reasons for their lack of covariance and similar effects remain unclear.",

      "content": "However, vacuolization alone is not specific to VEXAS, as it can also be seen in conditions such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), metabolic disorders, and toxic exposures. VEXAS syndrome, a postzygotic mutation-driven autoinflammatory disease caused by somatic mutations in the UBA1 gene, leads to chronic immune activation, clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells, and systemic inflammation. UBA1 mutations result in protein misfolding, contributing to both hematologic and inflammatory abnormalities. In VEXAS syndrome, specific features of vacuolated progenitor cells suggest the diagnosis. These include a high number of vacuolated cells, increased vacuoles per cell, a predominance of vacuoles in early progenitors rather than later stages, and vacuolization in both myeloid and erythroid progenitors, with myeloid progenitors most affected. However, the absence or low frequency of vacuolated cells should not rule out the possibility of VEXAS, and UBA1 gene sequencing should still be considered, especially in patients with unexplained systemic inflammation, MDS, or associated with other hematologic disorders. These mutations may alter the BM microenvironment, promoting the survival and expansion of mutant clones, which drive disease progression. While there is no standard treatment for VEXAS, the condition provides a unique model for understanding how inflammation in the BM microenvironment contributes to clonal selection and hematologic malignancy development. Research into the genetic and molecular mechanisms behind BM vacuolization in VEXAS has improved the diagnostic approaches and enhanced our understanding of its impact on hematopoiesis. Ongoing studies into the interplay between vacuolization, clonal hematopoiesis, and immune dysregulation will be a key to developing effective therapies for this complex syndrome. We herein offer a comprehensive diagnostic approach to BM vacuolization linked to VEXAS syndrome, distinguishing it from vacuoles observed in other conditions. The analysis delves into the clinical and hematologic features, molecular pathways, and rapidly evolving diagnostic methods for VEXAS syndrome, emphasizing its impact on hematopoiesis from a hematologic perspective.",

      "content": "The situation calls for a paradigm shift in health care practice towards an interpretive, person-centred model. Medical educators urgently need to teach medical students how to integrate biomedical and interpretive approaches to illness but practical pedagogy in the field is lacking. Medicines optimisation (MO), which encompasses deprescribing, provides an everyday case study of a curriculum theme requiring the everyday integration of potentially dissonant illness perspectives to achieve learning applicable for clinical practice. By clarifying 'what works, for whom, under what circumstances, how and why' in MO education, we can better support the practical integration of dissonant illness perspectives in wider medical education. A realist review was conducted in keeping with the Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards (RAMESES) guidelines identifying MO educational interventions trialled in undergraduate medical curricula globally and developing a programme theory (PT) illuminating the contexts, mechanisms and outcomes related to these interventions. Databases including Medline, Embase, Scopus and ERIC were searched. Inclusion criteria focused on undergraduate MO/deprescribing educational interventions and were iteratively adjusted for PT development. Analysis of 56 documents highlighted four key components needed to integrate biomedical and interpretive illness perspectives: the role of stakeholder perceptions influencing prioritisation, resource allocation and engagement; meaningful inclusion into summative assessments; learners' appreciation of their professional role and responsibility; and alignment of programmes with workplace and institutional culture. Our PT uniquely unpacks the black-box of undergraduate MO educational programmes and will be developed through subsequent evaluations. The PT provides insight for educators in clinical pharmacology and more widely as an exemplar of education requiring the practical integration of biomedical and interpretive illness perspectives required of modern practitioners.",

Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a rare immunostimulatory form of cell death and can activate adaptive immune responses as a way to remodel the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In this study, we found that bufadienolide-based nanocrystalline formulations (HBE NCs) can reshape the tumor microenvironment by inducing an ICD, thereby achieving superior anti-tumor efficacy. HBE NCs could effectively induce Hepa1-6 cells to release damage-associated molecular patterns, such as CRT as an \"eat me\" signal, HMGB1 as a \"danger\" signal and ATP as a \"find me\" signal to an active immune system. HBE NCs improved the maturation of dendritic cells, enhanced the infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup>T and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, depleted the number of immunosuppressive MDSCs and Treg cells, and successfully reconstructed immunosuppressed \"cold\" tumors into immune-activated \"hot\" tumors in HCC mice. Notably, dying Hepa1-6 cells treated with HBE NCs can be used as an <i>in vivo</i> \"inactivated vaccine\" to effectively enhance the ability of mice to resist the challenge of a live tumor. Our study demonstrates a promising strategy for remodeling the immunosuppressive TME of liver cancer.",

      "content": "<i>Objective</i>: To examine auditory-motor entrainment and spatiotemporal gait responses to system-controlled rhythm tempo increase before and after a community-based RAS walking intervention. <i>Methods.</i> Thirteen persons with PD used an autonomous closed-loop RAS system during 30 walking sessions. Baseline (BL) and post-intervention (POST) gait responses to tempo increase were assessed as participants walked with the system in a clinic hallway. Rhythm tempo, entrainment, cadence, stride length, gait speed, and stride time variability (STV) were measured during the first minute (tempo at preferred walking cadence, prior to increase) and fifth minute (tempo above preferred cadence, following increase) of each assessment. Within- and between-assessment responses of entrainment and spatiotemporal variables to tempo increase were evaluated. <i>Results.</i> During each assessment, participants entrained to rhythmic cues while significantly increasing their cadence and stride length in response to tempo increase. Gait speed increased significantly only during the POST assessment. Nearly 70% of participants had significantly lower mean STV at the POST assessment compared to BL, indicating increased gait rhythmicity. The between-assessment decrease in STV was associated with increased stride length. <i>Conclusions.</i> Study findings supported the potential of an autonomous closed-loop RAS system to induce entrainment and meaningful gait responses to system-controlled tempo increase in persons with PD. The system appeared to promote implicit motor learning processes during use. Associated post-intervention improvements in rhythmicity and stride length in a subset of participants were suggestive of fall prevention effects.<b>Trial registration:</b> Prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05421624).",

      "content": "<i>Methods</i>. This is a retrospective study. The MGB Biobank was queried for 570 individuals with stroke and available genomics data. A subset of 164 was curated based on their admission to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital (SRH) for inpatient rehabilitation, meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria and receiving a rehabilitation program tailored to their individual needs and goals. Functional independent measures (FIM) were assessed upon admission to SRH and discharge. Multiple tests were performed to identify related clinic characteristics associated with functional outcome, recovery, and independence dichotomization. Logistic and linear regression models adjusted for covariate variables were used to evaluate the association between <i>COMT</i> Val58Met and functional outcome and recovery. <i>Results</i>. Genotype analysis confirmed that <i>COMT</i> Met/Met frequency was higher compared to Val allele frequency in high cognitive functional outcome. Furthermore, after adjusting for covariate variables, <i>COMT</i> Met/Met led to positive cognitive outcome (<i>P</i> = 0.029; OR = 2.43 [0.19-4.56)] in comprehension (<i>P</i> = 0.013, OR = 0.62 [0.15-1.08]) and expression (<i>P</i> = 0.007, OR = 0.74 [0.19-1.25]). In independence dichotomization analysis, high cognitive outcomes (<i>P</i> = 0.04, OR = 0.81 [1.04-4.82]) were found in the sub-domains of comprehension (<i>P</i> = 0.002, OR = 1.21 [1.56-7.17]), expression (<i>P</i> = 0.03, OR = 0.83 [1.08-4.83]), problem solving (<i>P</i> = 0.02, OR = 0.88 [1.15-5.06]), and memory (<i>P</i> = 0.039, OR = 0.78 [1.04-4.58]). <i>Conclusion</i>.

In eight studies, the objective assessments were tested against professional walking aid prescription. Thirteen objective assessments reported the ability to distinguish the need for walking aid use. This scoping review identified limited evidence on objective assessments used for prescribing walking aids for people with balance impairment and/or falls risk. The findings provide guidance for future research, specifically aiming to discern people needing different walking aids.

However, the post-delivery fate of every component is less discussed such as the degradation, clearance, and retention in the body. The longevity and metabolites of each component can greatly influence overall tolerability and safety. For instance, slowly degrading ionizable lipids, which comprise around 50% of the LNP, have been shown to illicit an extended inflammatory response. In this review significant importance is placed on chemistries that improve the tolerability and safety of certain LNP components, such as molecular modifications to ionizable lipids, lipid-poly(ethylene glycol) and nucleic acids. Additionally, we discuss how formulation strategies, such as the amount of cholesterol and phospholipids added to optimize clearance, can enhance biodegradability and reduce inflammation. Furthermore, this review will provide an understanding of the considerations around designing LNP components for better or more predictable metabolism such modified nucleic acids and biodegradable chemical linkers in ionizable lipids.",

Vehicle-free drug delivery (VFDD) vis-à-vis conventional drug delivery (CDD), is advantageous as it does not require any vehicle to deliver the drug.

Synthesis, structure and supramolecular gelation behaviour of 20 PAD salts derived from 5 dicarboxylic acids - (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>-(COOH)<sub>2</sub> (<i>n</i> = 4, 7, 10, 12 and 14) - and 4 therapeutic amines - amantadine (AMN), tyramine (TRM), tryptamine (TRP) and mafenide (MAF) - are reported. Interestingly, 40% of the PAD salts were able to gel methyl salicylate (MS) - an important ingredient in many commercially available topical ointments. The gels were characterized by rheology and TEM. The underlying supramolecular interactions were analysed using single crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) studies carried out on as many as 9 salts. The gelator salt, C<sub>14</sub>·2MAF, containing anti-bacterial drug MAF as the amine part, showed excellent anti-bacterial behaviour against <i>E. coli</i>. Detailed biological studies suggested that the C<sub>14</sub>·2MAF anti-bacterial property is caused by bacterial cell membrane disruption and ROS generation. Gradual release of C<sub>14</sub>·2MAF from a MS-gel bed and sheer thinning of the gel phase, clearly indicated that the C<sub>14</sub>·2MAF MS gel has potential use as a supramolecular topical gel for anti-bacterial treatment.",

      "content": "We aimed to provide a descriptive analysis of reported cases of pharmacobezoar in VigiBase, the World Health Organization global database of adverse event reports for medicines and vaccines. We conducted a descriptive analysis of all de-duplicated individual case safety reports related to pharmacobezoars recorded in VigiBase, from its inception in 1968 to March 2, 2025. In a subgroup analysis, we selected reports containing at least one Preferred Term related to drug overdose, misuse, or suicidal behavior to identify potential cases of acute intoxication. A total of 632 individual case safety reports related to pharmacobezoars were analyzed. These primarily involved male patients (<i>n</i> = 318; 50.3%), with a median age of 60.0 years (IQR 43.0-71.0 years). Overall, 432 reports (68.4%) described serious adverse drug reactions. The most frequently involved drugs were carbidopa/levodopa (<i>n</i> = 148; 23.4%), quetiapine (<i>n</i> = 63; 10.0%), sucralfate (<i>n</i> = 46; 7.3%), nifedipine (<i>n</i> = 41; 6.5%), and acetylsalicylic acid (<i>n</i> = 40; 6.3%). The subgroup analysis included 158 reports related to acute intoxications, mostly involving female patients (<i>n</i> = 103; 65.2%), with a median age of 43.0 years (IQR 24.0-54.0 years). Almost all were serious (<i>n</i> = 156; 98.7%), with quetiapine, venlafaxine, ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, paracetamol, and lorazepam most frequently reported. The findings highlight the clinical severity and heterogeneous presentation of pharmacobezoars. Carbidopa/levodopa was frequently reported, possibly reflecting underlying conditions such as Parkinson disease with delayed gastric motility. The high prevalence of psychotropics underscores the need for targeted prevention in at-risk populations, particularly those with psychiatric comorbidities. While pharmacobezoars are rare, their association with serious and potentially fatal outcomes warrants increased clinical awareness. Early recognition and appropriate management may be particularly important in cases involving high-risk drugs.",

This prospective observational study evaluated patients with PAD undergoing revascularization and taking clopidogrel between 2022 and 2024. Whole blood samples were analyzed using thromboelastography (TEG) and VerifyNow testing. Patients were categorized based on their clopidogrel response: clopidogrel-resistant (>180 P2Y12 Reaction Units (PRU)) and non-resistant (<180 PRU). Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare the groups for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between platelet function and clopidogrel response (VerifyNow). Fifty-three patients were analyzed, 70% were male, and 23% were clopidogrel-resistant. Clopidogrel-resistant exhibited higher platelet reactivity (PRU 224.2 vs. 74.9, P<0.0001), faster clot formation (1.14min vs. 1.22min, P<0.0001), clot strength (ADP-MA 54.9 mm vs. 39.8 mm, P<0.0001), and reduced clot lysis (0.97min vs. 0.69min, P=0.0005) compared to non-resistant. Additionally, these patients showed a higher percentage of platelet aggregation (74.0% vs. 44.0%, P<0.0001) and a lower platelet inhibition (26.0% vs. 56.0%, P<0.0001), indicating a diminished response to clopidogrel and an increased risk of thrombosis. Clopidogrel-resistant group exhibited faster clot formation, greater clot strength, and higher platelet aggregation. Incorporating TEG into clinical practice could help identify patients at risk of inadequate clopidogrel response.",

      "content": "Many of these patients also have risk factors for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), but the optimal approach to identify the disease overlap remains unclear. Pretest probability for HFpEF was determined using the HFpEF-ABA algorithm among adjudicated group 3 or 4 patients at risk for pulmonary hypertension in the PVDOMICS study (Redefining Pulmonary Hypertension Through Pulmonary Vascular Disease Phenomics). Patients were stratified by current resting right heart catheterization criteria, and in a separate analysis, stratified only by HFpEF-ABA probability into low (<25%), intermediate, and high (≥75%) HFpEF probability groups. Among 598 patients with group 3 disease, 27% (n=161) had elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) with postcapillary pulmonary hypertension even at rest, which was associated with the highest exercise PCWP. However, regardless of this resting PCWP-based classification, a larger subset had intermediate-to-high HFpEF-ABA probabilities (32% [n=197] high and 57% [n=358] intermediate HFpEF probability). High HFpEF probability in group 3 disease was associated with higher resting and dynamic PCWP response to NO, fluid, and exercise (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all). These changes were comparable with more traditionally defined HFpEF without pulmonary vascular disease (n=61) but less severe than those with combined precapillary and postcapillary pulmonary hypertension HFpEF (n=31; interaction <i>P</i>=0.006). Increasing HFpEF probability in group 3 disease was associated with worse left heart remodeling, quality of life, 6-minute walk distance, and peak VO<sub>2</sub> (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all). Findings were replicated in group 4 disease (n=102). Quantifying pretest probability for HFpEF in patients with sleep apnea, lung disease, or chronic thromboemboli identifies a progressive gradient for dynamic PCWP abnormalities with worse functional status and quality of life. These subclinical left heart abnormalities are not universally detectable by resting right heart catheterization alone and call for further study of whether strategies to prevent or treat HFpEF might improve functional status in these patients with high risk of occult HFpEF.",

      "content": "We hypothesize that pharmacological enhancement of SK channels can be protective against malignant cardiac arrhythmias associated with disturbances in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling machinery. A mouse CASQ2 KO (calsequestrin type 2 knockout) model of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was used for in vivo ECG recordings and for cell electrophysiology, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and reactive oxygen species imaging in isolated ventricular myocytes (VMs). Bidirectional and polymorphic ventricular tachycardias in CASQ2 KO mice induced by stress challenge (epinephrine+caffeine cocktail) were attenuated by injection of NS309, a specific SK channel enhancer. Voltage-clamp experiments in isolated VMs treated with β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol showed a reduction of sarcolemmal SK channel current (I<sub>SK</sub>) density in CPVT VMs. Application of NS309 to CPVT VMs increased I<sub>SK</sub>. Current-clamp experiments demonstrated a significant reduction of arrhythmogenic delayed afterdepolarizations and spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in isoproterenol-challenged CPVT VMs pretreated with NS309. Importantly, subsequent application of membrane-impermeable SK channel inhibitor apamin did not reverse the protective effects of NS309, suggesting important roles of mitochondrial SK channels in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling rescue. SK channel enhancement reversed the increased rate of reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria in CPVT VMs. It also reversed increased cardiac RyR2 (ryanodine receptor 2) oxidation measured in samples from CPVT hearts of the animals after the stress challenge. Electron microscopy studies showed a significant widening of mitochondria cristae in the ventricular tissue from CPVT mice, which led to a decrease in quaternary supercomplexes of electron transport chain, resulting in impairment of ATP production in VMs under β-adrenergic stimulation. Application of NS309 facilitated cristae flattening in CPVT ventricular tissue and restored supercomplexes and ATP production in VMs from diseased animals. Sarcolemmal SK channel enhancement reduces arrhythmic potential by restoring repolarization force in CPVT VMs. Activation of mitochondrial SK channels attenuates mitochondria structural changes in CPVT, restoring more efficient electron transport chain assembly into supercomplexes and reducing mito-reactive oxygen species production. This decreases RyR2 oxidation and thus channel activity, reducing spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves underlying arrhythmogenic delayed afterdepolarizations.",

In this study, we systematically review the current studies of <i>H. pylori</i> heteroresistance and summarize the detection methods and possible heteroresistance mechanisms. In brief, it is highly significant to further strengthen the general understanding for <i>H. pylori</i> heteroresistance. Accordingly, it is necessary to conduct extensive clinical studies on the incidence of <i>H. pylori</i> heteroresistance and to refine the clinical definition of <i>H. pylori</i> heteroresistance. The development of accurate and standardized detection technology is the key to heteroresistance diagnosis. In addition, we strongly advocate to further study the heteroresistance mechanism of <i>H. pylori in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, which will advance the development of more effective treatment strategies and facilitate the refinement of clinical guidelines.",

      "content": "Little is known about their biological cargo, cellular origin/destination, and functional roles in human atherosclerotic plaque. EVs were enriched via size exclusion chromatography from human carotid endarterectomy samples dissected into paired plaque and marginal zones (symptomatic n=16, asymptomatic n=13). EV-cargos were assessed via whole transcriptome microRNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry-based proteomics. EV multiomics was integrated with bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets to predict EV cellular origin and ligand-receptor interactions, and multimodal biological network integration of EV-cargo was completed. EV functional impact was assessed with endothelial angiogenesis assays. Carotid plaques contained more EVs than adjacent marginal zones, with differential enrichment for EV-microRNAs and EV-proteins in key atherogenic pathways. EV cellular origin analysis suggested that tissue EV signatures originated from endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and immune cells. Integrated tissue vesiculomics and single-cell RNA-sequencing indicated complex EV-vascular cell communication that changed with disease progression and plaque vulnerability (ie, symptomatic disease). Plaques from symptomatic patients, but not asymptomatic patients, were characterized by increased involvement of endothelial pathways and more complex ligand-receptor interactions, relative to their marginal zones. Plaque EVs were predicted to mediate communication with endothelial cells. Pathway enrichment analysis delineated an endothelial signature with roles in angiogenesis and neovascularization, well-known indices of plaque instability. This was validated functionally, wherein human carotid symptomatic plaque EVs induced sprouting angiogenesis in comparison to their matched marginal zones. Our findings indicate that EVs may drive dynamic changes in plaques through EV-vascular cell communication and effector functions that typify vulnerability to rupture, precipitating symptomatic disease. The discovery of endothelial-directed angiogenic processes mediated by EVs creates new therapeutic avenues for atherosclerosis.",

Two main themes emerged from the analysis, each with related subthemes. Theme 1-Long-term music therapy fosters subjective well-being in the child and family, includes three subthemes: (a) sharing joy through musical interactions supports well-being; (b) an opportunity for the child to be themselves; and (c) music as a support for daily life. Theme 2-Parent perceived changes to their child's development, includes six subthemes: (a) focusing on the whole child; (b) supporting cognitive development; (c) supporting social skills; (d) supporting emotional skills; (e) supporting body awareness; and (f) developing child strengths and resources. These mothers shared that long-term music therapy sessions with their child supported them to experience a sense of relief and catharsis, which they considered helped them to cope with the challenges they faced when adapting to the different developmental path of their children. Additionally, the analysis of the parent interviews reveals their perceptions that long-term music therapy can bolster family well-being by facilitating emotional expression and capitalizing on the child's strengths. This qualitative study therefore highlights the potential multifaceted benefits of long-term music therapy, providing valuable insights into its possible role in enhancing the lives of autistic children and their families.",

Few studies have reported on the effects of air quality on the mucosal immunity of athletes. In this study, we recruited 32 male athletes and employed a randomized crossover design. Each participant provided 2 ml of saliva sample before and after their regular 2-h exercise sessions on days with and without air pollution. The immune molecules in saliva, including immunoglobulin A, lysozyme, α-amylase, and nitric oxide (NO), were measured. The results indicated that exercise on PM2.5-polluted days resulted in significantly higher post-exercise salivary NO levels compared to those on nonpolluted days and led to an increase in α-amylase activity compared to the pre-exercise condition. For the 16 atopic participants, the post-exercise salivary NO levels on PM2.5-polluted days were significantly elevated than nonpolluted days. Although athletes without a history of allergic conditions exhibited similar changes, the magnitude of these responses was less pronounced. In conclusion, PM2.5 pollution induces physiological stress and inflammatory responses in athletes, particularly those with allergies. More research is needed to determine the chronic effects of air quality on the mucosal immunity of outdoor athletes.",

In this study, we prepared three wood filters (balsawood, basswood, and Chinese fir) with different pore structures for the removal of the tetracycline (TC) antibiotic. We systematically investigated the structures and properties of the three wood filters to establish clear structure-property-performance relationships. By comprehensively considering the flux and TC removal efficiency, we selected the basswood filter as the optimal filter and further discussed the removal efficiency of the basswood filter and its removal mechanism for TC. When using five basswood filters, after continuously treating 120 mL of 0.5 mg L<sup>-1</sup> TC solution at 5000 L m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, a relatively high removal efficiency of over 85% could still be achieved. The filters retained ∼80.5% of their removal efficiency after five regeneration cycles, demonstrating excellent reusability. The further studies prove that there are three primary interaction forms in the process of TC removal by the basswood filter, which are electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding interaction, and π-π interaction. This is expected to be widely applied in actual wastewater treatment.",

The results of preliminary adsorption studies demonstrated high selectivity for copper ions (Cu<sup>2+</sup>), with no detectable selectivity towards nickel (Ni<sup>2+</sup>) or cadmium (Cd<sup>2+</sup>). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis revealed thermal stability variations with increasing MoP content, while atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed surface roughness and fibre defects. Rheological testing validated spinnability, and tensile analysis identified CeL-MoFs (2%) as the optimal composite, balancing mechanical strength and adsorption efficiency. These novel CeL-MoF composites, fabricated using EMIM DEP, are proposed as scalable, eco-friendly materials for selective heavy metal removal.

In this report, we present two patients with CTEPH and SCV thrombosis caused by VTOS who had successful multidisciplinary management and staged surgical treatment for both conditions. Each patient was young and otherwise healthy before presenting with progressively worsening shortness of breath. Both were found to have multiple peripheral PE and features of respiratory failure characteristic of CTEPH, along with axillary-SCV thrombosis and no other source of DVT. Each patient was treated with anticoagulation and riociguat but had ongoing pulmonary symptoms, and staged surgical treatment was recommended. The first stage was conducted by bilateral pulmonary thromboendarterectomy performed under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. The second stage was conducted several months later after resolution of pulmonary hypertension, by paraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression that included complete first rib resection with a patent axillary-SCV on subsequent upper extremity imaging. Each patient recovered well with resolution of respiratory and upper extremity symptoms and a return to unrestricted activity by three months after the second operation. These patients are some of the first to have successful staged surgical treatment for CTEPH and SCV thrombosis caused by VTOS, illustrating the value of comprehensive multidisciplinary management for this unusual combination of rare conditions.",

      "content": "Bladder cancer (BC) is a significant global health concern and includes non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC), which poses challenges due to recurrence and progression. Immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), shows promise particularly in cases of BCG failure or BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, with ICIs emerging as a potential treatment option for these challenging cases. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to systematically compare the efficacy and safety of BCG with ICIs in NMIBC. The present meta-analysis identifies response predictors and treatment outcomes, which can help in recognizing potential biomarkers such as tumor characteristics, hemoglobin levels and baseline performance status, associated with therapy response. These insights may guide future research in developing personalized treatment strategies for BCG non-responsive NMIBC cases. Following the Preferred Reporting Standards for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic literature search identified relevant studies published between January 2015 and April 2024. Randomized controlled trials and clinical trials involving patients with BCG-refractory NMIBC were included in the primary analysis. Data extraction and analysis were conducted using Review Manager version 5.4, employing a random effects model. The risk of bias assessment followed the Cochrane guidelines.",

      "content": "The present study included 2,154 participants across 10 studies evaluating treatments for NMIBC. Primary comparisons focused on BCG vs. ICIs: Pembrolizumab significantly improved tumor control (OR, 4.67; 95% CI, 1.43-15.25; P=0.01), progression-free survival (PFS; OR, 4.85; CI, 1.58-14.85; P=0.006), and overall survival (OS; OR, 3.61; CI, 1.28-10.19; P=0.02). Atezolizumab similarly outperformed BCG in metastatic disease (OR, 0.19; CI, 0.06-0.59; P=0.004) and lymph node involvement (OR, 0.43; CI, 0.20-0.93; P=0.03). ICIs exhibited a favorable safety profile vs. BCG, with fewer incidents of anemia (OR, 2.87; P=0.001) and diarrhea (OR, 1.79; P=0.03), despite higher rates of asthenia (OR, 7.33; P<0.00001) and pyrexia (OR, 3.26; P<0.00001). Exploratory comparisons with chemotherapy revealed pembrolizumab's advantages in terms of PFS (OR, 1.36; P=0.02) and OS (OR, 1.31; P=0.005), while atezolizumab improved metastatic control (OR, 0.54; P=0.0008). Heterogeneity was low for BCG comparisons (I<sup>2</sup>=0%) but high for chemotherapy (I<sup>2</sup>=81-95%). In conclusion, ICIs, particularly pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, demonstrate superior efficacy and safety over BCG in BCG-refractory NMIBC, supporting their use as first-line alternatives. These findings advocate for a paradigm shift in managing BCG-unresponsive disease, emphasizing personalized immunotherapy.",

Notably, the IORT group achieved superior cosmetic outcomes, with 95.2% (20/21) of patients achieving a rating of excellent/good vs. 44.7% (17/38 patients) in the PORT group (P<0.001), alongside higher median cosmetic scores at all postoperative intervals (P<0.01). IORT also reduced healthcare utilization, shortening hospitalization by 23.8 days (12.1±5.1 vs. 35.9±3.5 days; P<0.001) and lowering costs significantly (33,117.98±6,281.17 vs. 77,789.55±7,000.90 CNY; P<0.001).

      "content": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. While immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promise in treatment, there is a need for reliable biomarkers to predict patient prognosis and guide personalized therapies. Palmitoylation, a post-translational modification, has been implicated in various cancer processes, yet its role in CRC prognosis remains unclear. Transcriptome, survival, somatic mutation and copy number variation data were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and the GSE17538 dataset was used for external validation. A palmitoylation-related risk signature was developed using univariate Cox regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on the median risk score. Prognostic accuracy was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves and Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) analysis with validation in an independent cohort. Functional enrichment, immune cell infiltration and drug sensitivity analyses were performed to explore underlying mechanisms and therapeutic implications. Subsequently, keratin 8 pseudogene 12 (KRT8P12) overexpression was evaluated in HT29 cells, and knockdown HT29 cell lines were generated using lentivirus. Cell proliferation was assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays, cell migration was evaluated by Transwell assay and cell apoptosis was assessed using Annexin-V/propidium iodide staining. A palmitoylation-related risk signature consisting of six genes (KRT8P12, ZDHHC3, PCOLCE2, MPP2, LARS2 and MMAA) was identified. High-risk patients exhibited significantly worse OS (HR=3.19; P<0.001) compared with low-risk patients. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed enhanced immune activity in the low-risk group, which was associated with higher expression of immune checkpoint genes. Immunotherapy prediction models indicated that low-risk patients might benefit more from immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

Cuproptosis, a copper-induced form of cell death, has been identified as a key process in LUAD progression; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying cuproptosis in LUAD and potential therapeutic targets remain unclear. The present study utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas database to retrieve mRNA expression profiles and clinical information of LUAD, identifying 10 candidate genes from differentially expressed genes associated with cuproptosis. Protein-protein interaction analysis indicated that CDK inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), an upregulated gene in LUAD, may function as a hub gene. Furthermore, multiple online databases were used to analyze Spi-1 proto-oncogene (SPI1), a transcription factor upstream of CDKN2A, which was downregulated in LUAD cuproptosis. The LinkedOmics database identified the p53-mediated cuproptosis-related pathway regulated by CDKN2A.",

After copper-induced cuproptosis in H1975 cells, SPI1 expression was upregulated, whereas CDKN2A expression was downregulated. When H1975 cells were pretreated with tetrathiomolybdate, the upregulation of SPI1 was inhibited and the downregulation of CDKN2A was also suppressed. Cell Counting Kit-8 assays indicated that SPI1 overexpression and CDKN2A knockdown facilitated elesclomol-CuCl<sub>2</sub>-induced cuproptosis. Western blot analysis revealed an inverse association between SPI1 overexpression and CDKN2A/p53 levels.

Analyzing the prevalence of trends is crucial to addressing health inequities and informing targeted interventions. The study of National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from 2019 to 2023 allowed us to observe how the pandemic affected cardiovascular care utilization when it decreased in 2020 and later rebounded into 2023 while investigating shifts in reported angina prevalence rates among main groups. Angina pectoris condition-related research requires assessment of current trends for effective health inequities intervention and targeted intervention planning. This study aims to examine the prevalence of angina pectoris among United States (US) adults from 2019 to 2023 and across demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors. Data from the NHIS were analyzed to determine the prevalence of angina pectoris, which was identified through self-reported diagnosis or symptoms. The identification of angina pectoris in the NHIS dataset was based on self-reported physician diagnosis alongside responses to definite survey questions regarding chest pain and discomfort consistent with the symptoms of angina. Angina pectoris was identified in the NHIS dataset based on self-reported physician diagnoses and responses to specific survey questions on chest pain or discomfort consistent with angina. Stratified analyses assessed variations in prevalence across key demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors over a five-year period. The statistical analyses included both inferential analyses and descriptive statistics, including hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation, to evaluate associations and divergences within the data. The prevalence of angina was evaluated across socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic groups using stratified analyses. The overall prevalence of angina pectoris remained stable (1.5-1.7%) from 2019 to 2023.",

      "content": "It is easier to administer than the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), which has been used to determine walking independence. However, the cutoff value of the SPPB for determining walking independence in patients with stroke remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the utility and cutoff values of the SPPB and BBS for determining walking independence in patients with stroke. Methods A total of 301 patients with stroke (mean age: 71.8±12.3 years) who were admitted to the convalescent rehabilitation ward of our center between July 2021 and June 2024 were included in this study. The SPPB, BBS, Stroke Impairment Assessment Set (SIAS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) were administered at discharge. Walking independence was defined as FAC ≥4, and non-independence was defined as FAC ≤3. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between walking independence and the SPPB and BBS, with adjustments for age, sex, body mass index, days since onset, history of stroke, SIAS, and MMSE as covariates. The cutoff values of the SPPB and BBS for determining walking independence were calculated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and the areas under the curve (AUC) for both measures were compared. The significance level was set at 0.05. Results Of the 301 patients, 184 were classified as walking independent, and 117 were classified as non-independent. The SPPB (odds ratio (OR)=2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.69-2.73) and BBS (OR=1.14; 95% CI: 1.25-1.56) were significantly associated with walking independence at discharge (p<0.001). The cutoff values for walking independence were ≥10 points for the SPPB (AUC: 0.948, sensitivity: 0.940, and specificity: 0.855) and ≥49 points for the BBS (AUC: 0.945, sensitivity: 0.967, and specificity: 0.821), without significant difference in AUC. Conclusions The SPPB demonstrated high discriminative accuracy comparable to the BBS, indicating its usefulness as a simple and practical evaluation tool.",

The main outcomes focused on odds ratios (ORs) for complete response (CR) in acute, delayed, and overall phases. Safety was assessed from trial descriptions. The certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE Pro. Two hundred and eighty-two records were identified initially, yielding eight eligible RCTs with a total of 1056 participants after screening. All studies targeted CINV in adults undergoing highly emetogenic chemotherapy. In the acute phase, both drugs demonstrated similar efficacy in nausea and vomiting control (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.63,1.62). During the delayed phase, no significant difference was observed (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.62,1.04). In the overall phase, olanzapine exhibited slightly better nausea control than aprepitant, with statistical significance (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.59,0.99). Emetic control was comparable across treatment arms (OR 0.93, 95 % CI 0.70-1.24). Olanzapine provided a clinically meaningful reduction in nausea. However, the sedation caused by olanzapine, which is significantly higher than that caused by aprepitant, can impair daily functioning, diminish treatment adherence, and increase fall risk.",

The clubs' medical and performance departments' primary mission is to reduce the risk of injury to these athletes, allowing them to have more playing and training time to develop their full capabilities. This study aimed to investigate whether participation in youth football tournaments with congested schedules increases the risk of injury in U15 footballers, particularly during critical stages of maturation. In this way, in a retrospective manner, an analysis was conducted of the injuries recorded after a period marked by the participation of a U15 elite team in a preseason youth football tournament. Additionally, the maturational stage of each athlete on this team was recorded and the external workload data through the Global Positioning System (GPS), which included total distance (TD), high-speed running (HSR), accelerations and decelerations greater than or less than 2 m·s<sup>-2</sup> (ACC-DEC2), and accelerations and decelerations greater than or less than 3 m·s<sup>-2</sup> (ACC-DEC3), from the weeks before the tournament were used, aiming to understand whether, in the injured athletes, the accumulation of these metrics during the tournament exceeded the accumulation of the same metrics before the tournament. According to the results obtained, eight athletes sustained injuries during the tournament and the two weeks following it. All injured athletes were in the circa or post-peak height velocity (PHV) maturation stage. In the analysis of the GPS data, it was found that 87.5%, 75%, and 50% of the athletes who suffered an injury exhibited higher rolling sum (RS) values during the tournament compared to their previously recorded maximum values regarding TD, HSR, and ACC-DEC2, respectively.",

The participation of young footballers in the circa-PHV and post-PHV stages of maturation in several games on consecutive days seems to induce negative consequences for the athletes, namely a greater risk of overuse and acute injuries. The external load metrics presented appear to correlate with the risk of injury, specifically a higher risk of injury in athletes whose accumulated values of TD, HSR, and ACC-DEC2 during competition participation are higher than those previously recorded. Conversely, the presence of higher accumulated values of ACC-DEC3 prior to competition participation compared to those recorded during the competition may be a protective factor regarding injury risk. Careful management of microcycles and applied workloads is a key task to control or prevent injuries and, in this way, increase the young footballers' participation in games and training.",

      "content": "There may be different sources of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) involved in the repair mechanism of damaged tissues in the organism. WJ-MSCs may differentiate into osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myocyte cells. Furthermore, MSCs show neuroprotective effects on neurons. Today, many MSC neuroregenerative treatments have been shown to be effective. Studies have shown that MSCs are more involved in paracrine effects due to their neuroprotective effect in multiple diseases such as multiple sclerosis, acute spinal cord injury and encephalomyelitis. The main aim of this study was to investigate the neuronal markers of stem cells after incubation with β-mercaptoethanol (BME). In our study, WJ-MSCs were thawed in a water bath at 37°C and cultivated in cell culture dishes. When the cell occupancy rate reached 60-70%, they were treated with 2 mM BME. At the first and third hours, MSCs were removed from the dishes, and flow cytometry and immunostaining revealed that BME's nestin, neuron filament light (NF-L), SOX1, SOX2, doublecortin (DCX), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Ki67, and CD44 were evaluated. Immunocytochemically, nestin and NF-L values ​​of MSCs exposed to BME increased at the first hour. In the flow cytometric evaluation, it was observed that nestin was high in the first hour. One of our aims in this study was to reduce the possible toxic side effects of BME for MSCs by exposing the BME used in previous studies at the minimum dose for neuronal differentiation. In our study, we showed first-hour changes similar to the neuronal differentiation obtained with pre- and post-induction in other studies.",

      "content": "This study aims to compare the outcomes of transcatheter interventions for TR with conventional surgical and medical management strategies. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that included 11 reports from 10 observational studies. One study compared both TTVI versus medical treatment and TTVI versus surgical treatment. The studies were retrieved through a literature search of PubMed, Scopus, and Embase from their inception until April 2024. The review followed the updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Out of six, four studies comparing TTVI with surgical therapy were included in the analysis (due to overlapping populations), while the remaining studies were included in the review. Additionally, five studies comparing TTVI with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) were also incorporated. Patients who underwent TTVI had significantly lower 30-day mortality rates (odds ratio (OR): 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): (0.20, 0.50), p < 0.00001), shorter hospital stays (mean difference (MD): -7.33, 95% CI (-8.23, -6.43), p < 0.0001), and lower rates of acute kidney injury (OR: 0.56, 95% CI (0.49, 0.64), p < 0.00001), respiratory complications (OR: 0.45, 95% CI (0.34, 0.60), p = 0.00001), and post-operative cardiogenic shock (OR: 0.31, 95% CI (0.06, 1.53), p = 0.15) when compared to surgical management. TTVI was consistently superior to medical therapy in all included studies, reducing both mortality and heart failure-related hospitalizations. Early intervention with TTVI in patients with low-to-moderate Tricuspid Regurgitation Integrated Score (TRI-SCORE) (recently validated externally, this score captures key outcome drivers, offering a simple and accurate way to predict post-operative mortality and guide the management of patients with TR) was associated with improved outcomes compared to medical therapy alone. Although the available evidence is limited by selection bias and lack of control for confounders, it suggests that TTVI is effective in older, high-risk patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery. Additionally, it shows the superiority of TTVI over medical therapy alone. Future research is necessary to define the optimal candidate profiles for TTVI.",

Over a six-month period, participants were recruited using a non-probability convenience sampling technique. The sample size of 296 was calculated using the WHO sample size calculator, with a 5% margin of error. The study included patients aged 18 years and older, of both sexes, diagnosed with any stage of CKD. Patients with acute kidney injury or significant disorders affecting phosphorus metabolism (e.g., primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancies) were excluded. A total of 296 patients with CKD from various etiologies were included in this study, consisting of 124 males (41.9%) and 172 females (58.1%). The age distribution was as follows: 20-39 years (17.6%), 40-49 years (26.7%), 50-59 years (29.4%), and ≥60 years (26.4%), with a mean age of 50.26 ± 12.14 years. Among the participants, 12.8% had CKD stage 2, 23% had stage 3, 33.4% had stage 4, and 30.7% had stage 5. Of the 296 patients, 77 (26%) were receiving hemodialysis, while 219 (74%) were on conservative management. The overall incidence of hyperphosphatemia was 56% (166 participants). Stage-wise, hyperphosphatemia was observed in 31.5% of CKD stage 2, 38.2% of stage 3, 72.7% of stage 4, and 61.5% of stage 5 patients. The study has shown a higher burden of hyperphosphatemia among CKD patients, with an overall incidence of 56%. The prevalence of hyperphosphatemia increased with advancing CKD stages, peaking at CKD stage 4 (72.7%) and continuously remaining high in stage 5 (61.5%). These results stressed the need for early detection and effective management of hyperphosphatemia, particularly in the later stages of CKD, to lessen its associated complications. Moreover, the demographic distribution, with a mean age of 50.26 ± 12.14 years and a female predominance (58.1%), reflects the need for targeted interventions tailored to this patient population.",

      "content": "Although several observational studies have been conducted, they have not led to the development of clear clinical guidelines, partly due to heterogeneous definitions and the absence of consensus regarding diagnostic criteria and management strategies. Aims To assess diagnostic practices and management of type 2 ACS in patients without pre-existing heart disease and to analyze these practices based on the availability of coronary angiography at the inclusion center. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of 25,225 patients who received a troponin assay in the emergency departments of two centers, one with and the other without coronary angiography facilities, from 2018 to 2019. We selected 224 patients without pre-existing heart disease who had type 2 ACS according to objective criteria. The study was designed as a retrospective, descriptive, and comparative analysis. Data on clinical characteristics, diagnostic labeling, and management strategies, including cardiology consultations and ischemic investigations, were collected and analyzed. Results The study populations from both centers were similar. Clinicians diagnosed type 2 ACS in only three (1.3%) cases, despite a high rate of cardiology consultations (180, 80.4%). Exploration was performed in 78 (34.8%) patients, revealing significant coronary lesions in 43 (64.2%) cases. In 118 (74.7%) patients without exploration during hospitalization, no rationale was documented. The presence of on-site coronary angiography did not significantly influence the decision to explore (p = 0.067). Exploration decisions were influenced by age (p < 0.001), family history (p = 0.006), ECG presentation (p = 0.034), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p = 0.02), and cardiology consultation request (p < 0.001). Conclusion Objective criteria allowed the selection of a homogeneous type 2 ACS population. The diagnosis is rarely made, highlighting the need for increased awareness among emergency physicians and cardiologists. Integrating objective criteria into clinical guidelines could be considered. Given the high rate of underlying coronary lesions, patients with type 2 ACS and no pre-existing heart disease should be prioritized for coronary exploration.",

      "content": "We present the case of a 55-year-old woman with long-standing hypothyroidism who continued to experience persistent symptoms despite being on high-dose oral levothyroxine (1500 mcg daily). Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 14.160 mIU/L, along with positive anti-gliadin and anti-parietal cell antibodies. A supervised thyroxine (T4) absorption test confirmed true levothyroxine malabsorption. The patient was subsequently transitioned to a liquid levothyroxine formulation at a reduced dose of 600 mcg, which led to significant clinical improvement and normalization of thyroid function. Levothyroxine malabsorption can be attributed to underlying gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease and atrophic gastritis. The T4 malabsorption test is a valuable tool in distinguishing true malabsorption from non-adherence or pseudo-malabsorption. In cases of confirmed malabsorption, liquid or parenteral formulations may help improve absorption and lead to better clinical outcomes. This case highlights the importance of identifying thyroid hormone malabsorption in patients with refractory hypothyroidism to ensure optimal management and therapeutic success.",

      "content": "One of the most common etiologies is short bowel syndrome (SBS). For many years, intestinal transplantation was the only surgical option to achieve reduced dependence on parenteral nutrition (PN). However, intestinal lengthening surgery, such as serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP), has proven to be a safe and effective option for select patients with SBS, including those with ultra-short bowel syndrome (USBS) or PN-dependent SBS. Nevertheless, reported cases of STEP in adults are isolated due to the high complexity of the procedure. We present a case series of three patients with USBS and type III intestinal failure, in whom STEP was performed as part of intestinal rehabilitation. At the time of writing, one patient achieved enteral autonomy, while the other two have significantly reduced their PN requirements (by 33% and 20%, respectively) and improved oral tolerance. Autologous gastrointestinal reconstruction plays a key role in the treatment of intestinal failure secondary to SBS. Among the surgical options, STEP has been successfully used in children, though adult reports remain scarce, particularly for duodenal lengthening (with ≤ two cases reported globally). Postoperative outcomes are favorable, with low morbidity and mortality, offering the possibility of reducing PN dependence and, in select cases, avoiding intestinal transplantation. STEP is a complex but safe and effective procedure for adult patients with SBS, including USBS. It may enable reduced PN dependence, though further studies are needed to define its role in avoiding transplantation.",

Status epilepticus as an initial manifestation is uncommon and rarely reported. We report the case of a 42-year-old male with no prior seizure history who developed generalized status epilepticus during a long-haul international flight. Initial brain imaging revealed extensive bilateral basal ganglia calcifications. Laboratory investigations showed mild ionized hypocalcemia (0.99 mmol/L), secondary hyperparathyroidism, and vitamin D deficiency, with normal renal function. The patient admitted to smoking a significant amount of cannabis (13 joints) before boarding, which may have acted as a seizure trigger in the context of underlying metabolic vulnerability. Secondary Fahr syndrome was diagnosed based on clinical, radiological, and biochemical findings. This case highlights a rare but serious presentation of Fahr syndrome with in-flight generalized status epilepticus.",

The rising prevalence of ASD presents a significant public health concern, with no pharmacological treatments available for its core symptoms. Therefore, early and effective behavioral interventions are crucial to improving developmental outcomes for children with ASD. Current interventions primarily focus on educational rehabilitation methods, including Applied behavior Analysis (ABA) and the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM). This study aims to examine the developmental changes in children with ASD following six months of ABA therapy or ESDM intervention. From December 2021 to December 2023, 30 children receiving ABA therapy at the Zhejiang Rehabilitation Medical Center (40 min/session, 4 sessions/day, 5 days/week), while another 30 children undergoing ESDM training at Hangzhou Children's Hospital (2 h of one-on-one sessions and 0.5 h of group sessions/day, 5 days/week).",

The condition is marked by painful ulcers that heal slowly and have a tendency to recur. We report a case of a pediatric patient presenting with recurrent rashes and pain in both lower extremities. Physical examination revealed purpuric plaques with ulceration, scarring, and white atrophic healing features. Histopathological examination demonstrated intradermal thrombosis, vessel wall necrosis, and surrounding inflammatory cell infiltration with erythrocyte extravasation. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining was positive. The clinical and pathological findings were consistent with a diagnosis of LV. The patient was treated with oral rivaroxaban. This case highlights the critical importance of early recognition and intervention in the management of LV. Clinicians should consider LV in the differential diagnosis when encountering patients with painful purpuric rashes. Improvement in pain following treatment with anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban, may indirectly support the diagnosis. A skin biopsy is essential for definitive diagnosis.",

All children met Damiani's criteria for the diagnosis of RP. One child underwent \"laryngotracheal reconstruction with hyoid graft + T-tube implantation + bioabsorbable corticosteroid-eluting stent implantation,\" while five children underwent \"balloon dilatation + T-tube implantation + bioabsorbable corticosteroid-eluting stent implantation.\" After the initial surgery, follow-up was performed every two months for a total of six months. Three bioabsorbable corticosteroid-eluting stents were placed in the upper left and upper and lower right T-tubes during this time. All eight children were seen in our department for outpatient follow-up: one child was extubated; five children remained in outpatient follow-up; and the remaining two children continued to be treated in the rheumatology and immunology department due to poor control of their primary disease. Tracheotomy can be used to rapidly improve symptoms of dyspnea in children with RP disease progression. In the stable stage of the disease, the minimally invasive surgical method of \"balloon dilatation + T-tube implantation + bioabsorbable corticosteroid-eluting stent implantation\" was adopted to reduce secondary injury caused by surgical trauma (to the extent possible) and to improve the survival and quality of life of the children.",

This retrospective study included 25 children diagnosed with type III biliary atresia, who underwent laparoscopic Kasai surgery between February 2018 and July 2022. Patients were divided into two groups: one with partial quadrate lobectomy and the other without. Data collected included age, gender, weight, incidence of cholangitis before and after surgery, one-year native liver survival, intraoperative blood loss, surgery duration, and jaundice clearance at 6 and 12 months. Follow-up results were compared between the groups. The partial quadrate lobectomy group (14 patients) had a mean weight of 5.50 kg and average age of 66.79 days, while the control group (11 patients) had a similar weight (5.50 kg) and a mean age of 71.09 days. Weight comparison showed no significant difference (5.50 kg vs. 5.50 kg, <i>P</i> = 0.427). One-year postoperative native liver survival was 9/14 in the partial quadrate lobectomy group vs. 6/11 in the control group (<i>P</i> = 0.654). Intraoperative blood loss was similar between groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05), but the shorter operative time (301 vs. 347 min) associated with partial quadrate lobe resection may reduce anesthesia-related risks in infants, particularly given their limited physiological reserve. The reduced cholangitis rate (29% vs. 73%) aligns with prior reports suggesting that improved hilar exposure facilitates more precise dissection of fibrotic remnants, potentially minimizing postoperative bile stasis and infection. Jaundice clearance (defined as TBIL <20 μmol/L) was achieved in 8/14 (57.1%) of the partial quadrate lobectomy group vs.",

This study examines the impact of left-behind experiences on depression in single-parent left-behind adolescents, particularly focusing on the mediating role of family satisfaction and the moderating effects of exercise frequency and separation age. Using cross-sectional data from the China Psychological Health Guardian Project (CPHG), which includes 23,523 single-parent left-behind adolescents aged 12-18, we collected data on left-behind experiences, depressive symptoms, family satisfaction, exercise frequency, and separation age through questionnaires.",

The findings indicate that left-behind experiences significantly predict depressive symptoms (<i>t</i> = 7.77, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and family satisfaction serves as a significant mediator in this relationship (Indirect effect = 0.261, <i>t</i> = 4.971, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Additionally, exercise frequency moderates the effect of family satisfaction on depression (<i>B</i> = 0.42, <i>t</i> = 3.681, <i>p</i> < 0.001), where higher exercise frequency lessens the negative impact of low family satisfaction on depression. These results highlight the crucial roles of family satisfaction and exercise frequency in reducing depressive symptoms among single-parent left-behind adolescents, suggesting that emotional support and regular exercise can enhance their mental health.",

The potential relationships between these variables were explored. The work withdrawal behavior of nurses in this study is characterized as being at a lower middle level. Work withdrawal behavior was positively correlated with feelings of underqualification and self-disgust, while showing a negative correlation with self-efficacy. Self-disgust and self-efficacy indirectly influence perceived underqualification and work withdrawal behavior. Both the mediating effect and the chain mediating effect were found to be significant. Self-disgust and feelings of underqualification can aggravate the work withdrawal behavior of nurses, while improving self-efficacy can help reduce this behavior. Nursing managers should create opportunities for skill development, prioritize the physical and mental health of nurses, and take steps to minimize work withdrawal behavior, thereby improving the quality of clinical nursing.",

Alternative strategies are needed to enhance treatment effectiveness. In two studies, we investigated positive emotion (elicited via humorous content) for attenuating disgust responses to film clips. In Study 1, <i>n</i> = 174 undergraduates were randomized to view either a humorous, sad, or neutral clip prior to a disgusting clip. In study 2, <i>n</i> = 294 undergraduate participants were randomized to either view two clips with discrete emotional content (purely disgusting and purely amusing) or two mixed emotional clips (disgust mixed with amusement, amusement mixed with disgust). Results of Study 1 showed that the humorous clip buffered against ratings of disgust. In Study 2, humorous content reduced reports of disgust. For both studies, the effect of the manipulation was not moderated by clinical characteristics, like disgust proneness, contamination concerns, or depression. Findings suggest that positive emotions can alter the appraisal of disgusting content, attenuating feelings of disgust, with potential clinical implications for treatment.",

The present review emphasizes the need to consider the various factors that can influence enhancing and impairing effects of emotion on cognition, in studies of both healthy and clinical groups. First, we discuss advances in understanding the circumstances in which emotion enhances or impairs cognition at different levels, both <i>within the same processes</i> (e.g., perception, episodic memory) and <i>across different processes</i> (i.e., episodic vs. working memory). Then, we discuss evidence regarding these opposing effects of emotion in a larger context, of the <i>response to stressors,</i> and linked to the role of individual differences (personality, genetic) affecting stress sensitivity. Finally, we also discuss evidence linking these opposing effects of emotion in a <i>clinical group</i> (PTSD), where they are both deleterious, and based on comparisons <i>across groups</i> with opposing affective biases: healthy aging (<i>positive bias</i>) vs. depression (<i>negative bias</i>).",

Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 24.0, employing methods such as descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, repeated measures variance analysis, and structural equation modeling. The study found that both MPA and BP are on the rise among college students and share a bidirectional longitudinal relationship. Under low-stress conditions, MPA significantly predicted subsequent BP, while under high-stress, BP significantly predicted subsequent MPA. Additionally, gender-specific analyses revealed that MPA significantly predicted subsequent BP in both male and female students, but BP only significantly predicted subsequent MPA in female students. MPA and BP mutually influence each other among college students, with this relationship being moderated by stress levels and gender. Personalized intervention measures should be adopted for college students of different genders and stress levels to effectively prevent and alleviate MPA and BP, promoting the healthy growth and comprehensive development of college students.",
