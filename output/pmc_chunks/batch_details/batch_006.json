The aim of this study is to investigate the effect and mechanism of HYP on ΖΕΑ-induced intestinal immunosuppression and intestinal injury in piglets. Histological and ultrastructural changes in the ileum of piglets were observed by H&E staining and transmission electron microscopy. The changes of intestinal microorganisms in the ileum of piglets were detected by 16S rRNA technology. Intestinal chemical barriers (MUC-1 and MUC-2), and physical barriers (β-Catenin, TJ-3, TJ-2, MYLK, Claudin2, and Claudin3) were measured by qRT-PCR. The intestinal immune barrier (sIg A) was detected by Elisa. Immune-related cytokines (TLR-4, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-18, IL-6, IL-17, IL-8, IL-25, and TNF-α) were detected by qRT-PCR. The content of ZEA in serum and ileum tissue was detected by Elisa. WB and qRT-PCR were used to detect ferroptosis related indicators (SLC7A11, Gpx4, FTH1, PTGS2, and ACSL4). Our results showed that HYP attenuated ZEA-induced tissue and ultrastructure damage and restored the richness and diversity of intestinal flora in the ileum of piglets. In addition, HYP also alleviated the accumulation of ZEA in the intestine and serum by restoring the chemical, physical and immunological barriers of the ileum. Moreover, HYP was found to attenuate ZEA-induced intestinal ferroptosis. Taken together, our study suggests that HYP can be used as an effective strategy to mitigate ZEA exposure-induced intestinal barrier damage and immune suppression in piglets.",

      "content": "Overexpression of the Aurora kinases has been reported in multiple cancer types. They play important roles in driving an oncogenic transformation of cancer cells by regulating their survival and proliferation, mainly because of the kinases' mitotic activity. Aurora kinase inhibitors (AKIs) were developed and tested in clinical trials and effectively suppressed many cancer types, suggesting the potential for Aurora kinases as a novel therapeutic target. Aurora kinase inhibition has also been well-documented to enhance chemotherapy effectiveness in various cancers. However, not all cancer types respond to AKIs, and the mechanisms behind the resistance are still elusive. This review will first briefly summarize the gene expression, regulation, and substrates of the Aurora Kinases, describe the function of Aurora kinases in mitosis, and then review the Aurora kinases' oncogenic roles in different cancer types as well as tumorigenesis, including cancer metabolism and anti-tumor immune evasion. In addition, we recapped the recent studies that revealed the critical role of Aurora Kinases in various cancer therapies and discussed the clinical outcomes of AKIs in combination with other types of therapies. Furthermore, we reviewed the current development of a new generation of AKI, such as PROTAC degrader. Further understanding the mechanism underlying the responsiveness of AKIs could help evaluate their effect and improve them as potential therapeutic targets.",

In this paper, we modified the structure of Meucin-18 in an attempt to obtain derived peptides with stronger antibacterial activity or less hemolytic toxicity.

At a dose of 500 mg/kg, it does not cause the death of galleria mellonella, and at 1000 mg/kg, the survival rate can still reach 66.6 %. Additionally, the in vivo therapeutic effects of CH-1 (15 mg/kg) in mice are comparable to those of VAN (15 mg/kg). CH-1 is a derived peptide obtained by replacing the fourth histidine of Meucin-18 with arginine, which has one more positive charge than Meucin-18. The additional positive charge further strengthened the electrostatic interaction of CH-1 with bacterial membrane. This may be the possible reason why CH-1 has excellent antibacterial effect. Overall, the design of the derived peptide CH-1 is successful and can be further evaluated for its druggability in future research.",

Risk assessment is purported to be the gold standard in prevention. This study examined the association between the time of pressure injury risk assessment, the presence of a pressure injury prevention management plan, and the development of hospital-acquired pressure injury(s) in the high-risk cohort of hip fracture patients at a regional base hospital in New South Wales. A retrospective descriptive study was conducted from routinely collected data, extracted from the electronic medical record and the incident management system. Patients with hospital-acquired pressure injuries were matched to those without and comparisons were made. Four hundred and eighty patients presented with a primary diagnosis of hip fracture. Twenty-four (5 %) developed at least one pressure injury during admission. Eight (33 %) of the study group and four (16.5 %) of the comparison group had a risk assessment completed within 8 h per hospital procedure. There was no correlation between risk assessment within 8 h and development of a pressure injury. Patients who developed pressure injuries were older than those who did not (mean 86 vs 80 years, p = 0.021). There was no correlation between early pressure injury risk assessment and pressure injury development for hip fracture patients. Formal risk assessment by nurses did not prevent pressure injuries in patients with high-risk presentation of hip fracture. Maximum prevention strategies should be routinely implemented by nurses.",

Two-hundred-and-ten patients with idiopathic CD were recruited from 10 movement disorders centers from the US, Canada, Australia, and UK. At the end of each botulinum toxin cycle, participants were administered the Adult Standard Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) as reference standard for depression and anxiety. Participants completed 8 self-administered index instruments (2 for depression, 2 for anxiety, and 4 combining screening for both). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, covariate-adjusted area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and likelihood ratios were calculated for all instruments. On the MINI, 8.6 % (100 % female) fulfilled criteria for current major depressive disorder and 10.5 % (91 % female) fulfilled criteria for any current disorder amongst panic, social anxiety or generalized anxiety disorders. For depression screening, all tools had an AUC higher than 0.80, with the two most accurate being the BDI-II (AUC 0.91, sensitivity 87.5 %) and the HADS-Depression (AUC 0.88, sensitivity 93.7 %). For anxiety screening, the only instrument showing clinical usefulness was the HADS-Anxiety (AUC 0.82, sensitivity 86.3 %). Current major depression can be screened in CD with high degree of accuracy using different self-administered scales, whereas existing screening tools for anxiety perform worse. Dystonia-specific instruments are less accurate than scales developed for the general population.",

A total of 48, 24-week-old No. 6 Jingfen laying hens were randomly divided into four groups of 12 hens each: the CON group (basal diet), IAA group (basal diet + 150 mg/kg IAA), LPS group (basal diet), and IAA+LPS group (basal diet + 150 mg/kg IAA). The feeding period lasted 8 weeks, and at the end of the 8th week, the laying hens in the LPS and IAA+LPS groups were intraperitoneally injected with 0.5 mg/kg LPS. The four groups were uniformly slaughtered and sampled 12 h after LPS injection. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) was significantly alleviated (P < 0.05), and antioxidant enzymes (T-SOD, CAT, GSH-PX) were significantly elevated (P < 0.05) in the serum and liver of the IAA+LPS group. Histological analysis revealed reduced hepatocyte necrosis and inflammation in the IAA-treated groups (P < 0.05). Additionally, the activation of MAPK and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways was modulated through transcript analyses, thereby reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. In summary, IAA effectively mitigates liver inflammation and oxidative stress through the regulation of MAPK and TLR signaling pathways, providing a promising strategy for improving liver health in hens. This study represents the first report on the application of IAA in poultry, demonstrating its potential as a novel therapeutic agent for alleviating liver injury.",

Further mutagenesis experiments revealed that DPV US3 kinase activity was essential for phosphorylating STING, reducing STING dimerization, and inhibiting STING-mediated antiviral responses. Sequence alignment and mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that DPV US3 phosphorylates STING at serine 86, near the Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention sequence (R<sub>82</sub>YRGS<sub>86</sub>), disrupting its association with tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inducing STING degradation. Finally, US3 knockout attenuated DPV replication by activating higher levels of IFN and ISGs in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that DPV promotes viral infection and pathogenicity by inducing STING degradation through the encoded US3 kinase, providing new insights into the mechanism of DPV immune evasion.",

There were no differences among these parameters found attributable to genetic strain. However, all strains exhibited similar stress responses at critical time points throughout the lay cycle. HSP70 expression was highest at the end of lay (p < 0.0001), HSP90a at the start of lay (p < 0.0001), and both HSP90b and heterophil lymphocyte ratios at peak lay (p < 0.0001), suggesting a potential relationship between the two.

However, in this study, the incidence of wing bone deformity reaches more than 10 %. Such a high fracture rate reduces the quality and benefits of wing products. It is necessary to study the wing bones, find the relevant gene loci and enhance the strength of wing bones. A total of 436 Cornish White chickens were used as experimental birds. The weight, length, width, strength and toughness of ulna, radius, humerus and tibia, as well as growth and breast muscle traits, were measured, and correlation analysis was performed. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed and a linear mixed model was used to analyze 39,000 SNPs from a self-developed broiler microarray. The genetic parameters of the traits were calculated. The results showed that the coefficient of variation of the toughness of the wing bone was greater than 20 %, and that of the ulna was 34.45 %. Wing bone traits were negatively correlated with feed conversion ratio and positively correlated with tibia traits and growth traits, reaching 0.8, and weakly correlated with breast muscle traits (P > 0.05).",

      "content": "However, the mechanism of lymphocyte migration across the mammary epithelium remains unclear. Hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy are known to influence lymphocyte homing to the breast. In this study, we established a mammary epithelial cells (MECs)/T lymphocytes co-culture system to investigate the effects of colostral hormones on lymphocyte migration. Electron microscope and fluorescence-activated cell sorting results showed that the proportion of T lymphocytes in colostrum was about 9 %. Subsequently, the hormone concentration and number of T lymphocytes in colostrum were tested. The results revealed that there is a high content of prolactin and estrogen in colostrum, and the content of prolactin and estrogen is positively correlated with the number of T lymphocytes in colostrum. Furthermore, T lymphocytes were added to the upper ventricle in Transwell insert, and the estrogen and prolactin were added to the lower ventricle. The results showed that prolactin significantly promoted the T lymphocyte migration across the mammary epithelium, while estrogen had no effect. Finally, our study found that prolactin can promote the mammary epithelial cell to secrete CCL2 by Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In order to further explore the transepithelial migration, a neutralizing antibody was applied to block CCL2. Results revealed that the migration of T lymphocytes across the breast epithelium was significantly inhibited after blocking CCL2. The above results showed that prolactin can promote the secretion of CCL2 by breast epithelial cells, and regulate the lymphocyte migration across the mammary epithelium into colostrum, and thereby may further improve lactogenic immunity in sows.",

Each experimental diet was assigned to 6 replicates of 4 broilers, either 11 to 14 days or 25 to 28 days of age. The total excreta collection method was employed to determine the ME of the experimental diet for the calculation of the ME of BSG. Correlations between the chemical composition and ME of BSG were analyzed, and stepwise regression models for apparent metabolizable energy (AME) and nitrogen-corrected AME (AME<sub>n</sub>) were established for broilers aged 11 to 14 days and 25 to 28 days. Substantial variations in crude protein (CP; 18.63% to 38.94%, CV=27.0%) and crude fiber (CF; 11.97% to 32.15%, CV=31.2%) contributed to a wide range of ME values (667 to 3392 kcal/kg DM) across the 10 sources of BSG. Principal component analysis of the chemical composition clearly showed substantial variability in the quality of the BSG samples, as reflected by the dispersed scores of chemical components. Eight of 10 BSG samples had close ME values in broilers aged 11 to 14 days and 25 to 28 days. However, notable differences in ME were observed between these age groups for BSG samples 1 and 5 (P<0.05). The AME and AMEn of BSG were positively correlated with CP, ether extract (EE), and gross energy (GE; P<0.05), but negatively correlated with CF, ash, and acid detergent fiber (ADF) in both age groups (P<0.05). For broilers aged 11 to 14 days, the AME and AMEn of BSG were best predicted by CP and EE contents (R<sup>2</sup>≥0.902, RMSE≤292.9 kcal/kg DM, P<0.01). For broilers aged 25 to 28 days, the AME and AMEn of BSG were best predicted by GE and EE contents (R<sup>2</sup>≥0.926, RMSE≤217.7 kcal/kg DM, P<0.01). This study developed robust, age-specific prediction equations for ME in broilers based on the chemical composition of BSG. Overall, ME values for BSG can be reliably predicted from its CP, EE and GE contents.",

      "content": "This investigation was conducted to explore the interplay between the central glycinergic and adrenergic systems in regulating feed consumption among egg-type chickens. To this end, six separate experiments were performed. The first experiment involved intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of normal saline and glycine at different doses (50, 100, and 200 nmol) to determine its effective dose. In experiments 2-6, sub-effective doses of various adrenergic receptor antagonists-prazosin (an antagonist of α1 receptor), yohimbine (an antagonist of α2 receptor), metoprolol (an antagonist of β1 receptor), ICI 118.551 (an antagonist of β2 receptor), and SR 59230R (an antagonist of β3 receptor)-were co-administered with an effective dose of glycine to assess the potential involvement of adrenergic receptors in glycine-mediated feed intake. The cumulative feed consumption was subsequently measured at intervals of 30, 60, and 120 minutes post-administration. The findings indicated that glycine infusion at doses of 100 and 200 nmol significantly reduced meal consumption in layer chickens compared to the saline-treated control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, co-infusion of a β2 receptor antagonist attenuated the hypophagic effects typically induced by glycine (P < 0.05). However, co-administration of α1, α2, β1, and β3 receptor antagonists did not alter glycine-induced hypophagia (P ≥ 0.05). These findings suggest that the role of glycine in decreasing feed consumption in layer chickens could be facilitated by β2 adrenergic receptors.",

Moreover, we demonstrated that circRALGPS2 functions as a molecular sponge for miR-200a-3p, revealing that miR-200a-3p and circRALGPS2 exert antagonistic effects on GC autophagy and apoptosis. Mechanistically, circRALGPS2 targets miR-200a-3p, which subsequently modulates the expression of transforming growth factor β2 (TGFβ2), thereby activating the canonical TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that circRALGPS2 promotes apoptosis and autophagy in chicken GCs through activation of the TGFβ2/SMAD pathway via miR-200a-3p sequestration. These results provide valuable insights for advancing chicken genetic breeding technologies through marker-assisted selection.",

Blood samples were collected at 91 days and 140 days after hatching to measure the levels of various reproductive hormones. Subsequently, the two groups with the most significant differences in reproductive hormone levels were chosen for in-depth transcriptomic analysis. Select the two groups with the greatest differences in reproductive hormones for transcriptomic analysis. Results showed that at 90 days of age, the duration of light exposure had no significant effect on the levels of GnRH, FSH, and LH (P > 0.05); at 140 days of age, with prolonged exposure to light, the levels of GnRH, FSH, and LH in the blood will significantly or extremely significantly increase (P < 0.05).",

Participants underwent detailed ophthalmologic evaluation, including OCT measurements of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell complex (GCC) in both eyes. Group comparisons were conducted using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests, with ANCOVA to adjust for age and gender. Subgroup analyses were performed based on mood stabilizer use. GCC thickness in the right eye (superior, inferior, and average) and left eye (superior and average) was significantly reduced in BD patients compared to controls (p < 0.01). Unaffected relatives also demonstrated reduced GCC values in several parameters, supporting a potential heritable component. RNFL thickness was largely comparable across groups, except for increased right inferior RNFL thickness among lithium users. Group differences in GCC remained significant after adjusting for covariates. GCC thinning was more prominent in the right eye, consistent with hypotheses of hemispheric asymmetry in BD. GCC thinning, observed in both BD patients and their unaffected relatives, may reflect a genetically mediated vulnerability and support its role as an endophenotype of bipolar disorder. Retinal imaging via OCT offers a non-invasive, scalable method for identifying trait-level neurobiological alterations and may aid in early detection of at-risk individuals.",

The primary outcome was the incidence of ischemic stroke. Secondary outcomes included mortality rates, intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator-free days, and discharge disposition. A total of 3521 adult trauma patients with isolated BCVI were included, of which 3454 (98.1%) were managed nonoperatively, 21 (0.6%) were managed operatively, and 46 (1.3%) were managed with endovascular repair. There was no significant difference in evaluated outcomes when comparing endovascular repair to nonoperative management. When comparing endovascular repair to operative management, the majority of outcomes were comparable; however, patients treated with endovascular repair experienced significantly more ventilator-free days compared to those managed operatively (β 0.572, 95% confidence interval -1.764 to 2.908, P = 0.002). In patients with moderate-to-severe BCVI, endovascular repair outcomes were comparable to both operative and nonoperative management, indicating its viability as a safe treatment option. Further research is needed to identify patient characteristics that influence outcomes and establish clearer evidence for endovascular repair's effectiveness and safety in this population.",

Since the MALDI-TOF profile of this pathogen is absent from the database and 16S rRNA sequencing fails to resolve its identity to the nearest neighbour, a definitive genetic marker is required for unambiguous identification of the organism. Given the increase in the number of reported clinical cases, there exists a need for a rapid method for identification of the organism which could be utilised in a range of environments including the clinical setting. This study describes the design, development and validation of a specific and sensitive real-time PCR assay for the specific detection of P. piersonii. The assay targets a unique region of the malate dehydrogenase gene, confirmed through comparative genomic analysis. We demonstrate the performance of the assay in terms of analytical specificity, sensitivity, and robustness, ensuring its suitability for both space microbiology applications and clinical use.",

Blood-based biomarkers offer a minimally invasive and accessible alternative to costly and inconsistent neuroimaging or brain tissue analyses. High-throughput RNA sequencing has revealed differentially expressed genes associated with immune dysregulation and inflammation, implicating cytokine signaling, complement activation, and oxidative stress in SCH pathophysiology. These findings provide insights into the disorder's underlying mechanisms and pave the way for targeted therapeutic strategies. Emerging treatments aim to modulate these pathways, with a focus on anti-inflammatory agents, antioxidants, and immune system regulators. In this review, we highlighted that integrating biomarker discovery with innovative therapeutic approaches holds promise for improving diagnostic precision, tailoring treatments, and developing novel therapies that address specific molecular pathways in SCH, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.",

We relied on the University Cancer Center database to investigate outcomes in metastasis-free (MFS), cancer-specific (CSS) and overall survival (OS) of cT3-4 and cN1 RP versus RT-treated patients between 2014 and 2024. Of 1017 cT3-4 patients, 93% underwent RP, which were significantly younger (67 vs. 75 years) and harbored significantly lower PSA level (9.3 vs. 12.7 ng/ml). Moreover, significant higher rates of ISUP4-5 in RT patients were observed (51% vs. 37%, P = .001). Univariable MFS, CSS and OS outcomes did not differ for cT3-4 patients. In multivariable adjusted MFS, CSS and OS outcomes also no difference between RP vs. RT-treated cT3-4 patients were observed (all P > .05). Of 239 cN1 patients, 87% underwent RP, which were also younger (66 vs. 73 years, P < .001) and with clinically meaningful lower PSA level (15.4 vs. 29.0 ng/ml, P = .09), relative to RT patients. In univariable MFS analyses, RT provided better results, with no differences for CSS and OS. However, after multivariable adjustment MFS, CSS and OS analyses showed no significant differences between RP vs. RT-treated cN1 patients (all P > .05). Real-world evidence of currently RP vs. RT-treated locally advanced cT3-4 and clinically node-positive prostate cancer patients suggest equally efficient cancer-control outcomes such as MFS, CSS and OS when adjusting for different patient and tumor characteristics and show excellent cancer control rates in this very-high risk cohort.",

There could be a potential neurobiological interplay between cerebral microbleeds and renal dysfunction in the context of ICH, with possible bidirectional influences on a molecular and cellular level.

The 6-year DOR rate was 19% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy; all patients in the chemotherapy arm were censored or stopped responding before this timepoint. Trends toward improved OS were observed with nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy over chemotherapy regardless of KRAS, STK11, KEAP1, or TP53 mutation status. No new safety signals were observed. These final analyses demonstrate the durable, long-term OS and response benefit with first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy over chemotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC, regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression, histology, or select somatic mutation status, further supporting this regimen as a standard-of-care treatment option.",

However, many women's behavioral health conditions go undetected and untreated. This brief highlights the extent of the US health system's failure to adequately screen for critical perinatal health conditions. Pooled data from the 2015-16, and 2018-19 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were generated to assess rates of screening for depression, alcohol use, substance use, and domestic violence during routine prenatal care visits. In the pooled 2015-2016 and 2018-2019 NAMCS sample (n = 1135) there were 82,986,275 weighted office visits for routine prenatal care. Clinicians most frequently identified as physicians. Screening data was nearly absent from the data, with domestic violence screenings being conducted most frequently at a reported 2.7 %. This study found behavioral health screening tools are used infrequently during office visits for routine prenatal care. While many clinicians endorse at least some behavioral health screening practices, the adoption of these screenings in all healthcare settings has not occurred.",

The biomimetic coordination of His with single-atom Co significantly enhances its peroxidase-like activity, rendering it 48-fold more active than natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP), with a Michaelis constant (Km) of 0.076 mM, much lower than the 3.7 mM observed for HRP. This enhanced activity results in the generation of more intense colorimetric signals when reacting with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The AI algorithm captures over 1000 sampling RGB points on the color-revealing sponge surface, achieving a color recognition rate of over 95 % within 5 s, ensuring rapid and accurate detection. The integration of nanozyme with AI-driven data acquisition addresses two critical challenges: the limited chromogenic intensity in low-centration biomarker detection and the potential subjectivity in color rendering results. Immobilized on a hierarchically porous sponge, the system achieves a detection limit of 0.28 μM, with less than 5 % signal variation across 20 repeated cycles. This integration of AI and nanozyme-based detection holds significant promise for advancing biosensors that provide precise data output, offering vast potential for widespread applications in the early detection of disease biomarkers and other analytes.",

Analysis revealed 7 major themes, including the metaphor's facilitating functions, harmful effects, differences between providers and patients etc. Metaphors were found to enhance provider-patient relationship and communication and promote shared understanding and decision-making. Metaphors play a significant role in provider-patient communication in medical settings, offering both benefits and challenges.

Thus, there can be a tendency to overestimate or underestimate the amount of tissue needed, thus increasing the donor and flap morbidity. In order to improve the accuracy of these dimensions and facilitate the minimization of tissue harvest as well as improve operative efficiency, we propose the first use of virtual surgical planning (VSP) in RFFF phalloplasty, and we describe its use in this case series. Using CT-guided analysis that takes into account extremity girth and three-dimensional soft tissue measurements, a precise and sterilizable template is created for use in surgical planning. This novel application of VSP in RFFF phalloplasty has the potential to both decrease operative time and donor site morbidity.",

Compared with homopolymers that were prepared using a single carboxybetaine methacrylate (CBMA), the copolymer formed by regulating the proportions of CBMA and (2-aminoethyl)methacrylamide hydrochloride monomers outperformed in terms of antifouling ability. Thiol-modified aptamers were subsequently immobilized on the polydopamine layer via Michael addition to construct an electrochemical sensor for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). The sensor exhibited strong antifouling performance in various simulated and real food matrices, with signal suppression as low as 0.54 %.",

Participants were recruited from 105 non-allergist primary care clinics across the United States using the QHSLab Digital Medicine platform between February 20, 2024, and January 18, 2025. Of the original sample, 891 participants completed the follow-up, yielding an attrition rate of approximately 14 %. Health-seeking behavior was defined as seeking professional assistance for emotional well-being, allergies, or neither. Baseline medication use for intranasal steroids, antihistamines, decongestants, and oral leukotriene blockers was recorded. Pearson correlations, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), chi-squared test (χ<sup>2</sup> test), and regression analyses explored relationships between these factors and health score changes (α = 0.05). Patients who actively sought help for emotional well-being and allergic rhinitis exhibited the most significant improvements in symptom severity and mental health outcomes. Pearson correlation analyses revealed a significant negative association between dual-condition help-seeking and reductions in both SNOT-22 (r = -0.22, p < 0.01) and PHQ-GAD scores (r = -0.34, p < 0.01). Regression analysis confirmed that help-seeking behaviors (HSB) were significant predictors of symptom improvement, with individuals seeking assistance for both conditions showing notable reductions in SNOT-22 (β = -0.19, p < 0.05) and PHQ-GAD scores (β = -0.28, p < 0.01). Longitudinal analyses further demonstrated that consistent HSB engagement over six months led to a 23 % greater reduction in SNOT-22 scores (β = -0.21, p = 0.03) and a 31 % greater reduction in PHQ-GAD scores (β = -0.27, p < 0.01) compared to pharmacologic interventions alone. Sensitivity analyses reaffirmed these findings, and mindfulness meditation (β = 3.54, p < 0.001) and allergen immunotherapy (β = 5.60, p = 0.0185) were identified as additional predictors of mental health improvement. These results highlight integrated care's critical role in addressing physical and mental health conditions to optimize patient outcomes. This study underscores the importance of help-seeking behaviors in improving allergic rhinitis and mental health outcomes, highlighting the benefits of integrated care approaches. Patients who sought help for both conditions experienced the most significant symptom relief, reinforcing the need for multidisciplinary, patient-centered treatment. Expanding mental health screening within AR management, enhancing access to behavioral interventions, and leveraging digital health tools can optimize patient engagement and long-term outcomes. These findings advocate for a holistic shift in AR care, emphasizing integrating physical and mental health support to improve overall well-being.",

In a prospective study, conducted at the Post-COVID Center of the University Hospital of Erlangen, patients were assessed at baseline (T0) and follow-up (T1; M = 4.46 months, SD = 2.27). Coping strategies were measured using the Patient Competence Questionnaire-2 (PCQ-2), including coping competence, religious/spiritual coping, healthy lifestyle, information-seeking, and adaptability. PASC symptom severity (PCS score), fatigue (FSS), post-exertional malaise (DSQ-PEM), and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) were also assessed. Among 339 participants (age: M = 45.51 years, SD = 11.96; 70.2 % women) coping competence improved significantly over time, while no notable changes were observed in the other factors and overall patient competence. Women scored higher than men in religious/spiritual coping, coping competence, and healthy lifestyle (all p < .001). Higher education levels were associated with higher scores in coping competence, information-seeking, and healthy lifestyle (p = .028, p = .014 and p = .012, respectively). Higher coping competence at T0 significantly predicted fewer symptoms of fatigue and depression (p = .021 and p < .001, respectively) at T1, whereas higher adaptability at T0 was associated with more severe fatigue, PEM, and depression at T1 (p < .001, p = .001 and p = .020, respectively).

Overcoming the current, time consuming, practise of manual delineation of brain tumours and providing an accurate, explainable, and replicable method of segmentation of the tumour area and related tissues is therefore an open research challenge. In this paper, we first propose a novel symbolic approach to brain segmentation and delineation of brain lesions based on spatial model checking. This method has its foundations in the theory of closure spaces, a generalisation of topological spaces, and spatial logics. At its core is a high-level declarative logic language for image analysis, ImgQL, and an efficient spatial model checker, VoxLogicA, exploiting state-of-the-art image analysis libraries in its model checking algorithm. We then illustrate how this technique can be combined with Machine Learning techniques leading to a hybrid AI approach that provides accurate and explainable segmentation results. We show the results of the application of the symbolic approach on several public datasets with 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images. Three datasets are provided by the 2017, 2019 and 2020 international MICCAI BraTS Challenges with 210, 259 and 293 MR images, respectively, and the fourth is the BrainWeb dataset with 20 (synthetic) 3D patient images of the normal brain. We then apply the hybrid AI method to the BraTS 2020 training set.",

However, it also faces some challenges, such as poor and fuzzy semantic representation of clinical record text and failure to consider the structural characteristics of clinical records. To address these problems, our study proposed an ICD Coding model (TRansformer and TRee-lstm for ICD Coding, TRIC), which enables adequate automatic ICD encoding of unstructured clinical records. In this model, the structure and features of clinical records are extracted by the constituency tree model and the transformer based model respectively, and the Tree-lstm model is used to enrich the features. Then bioBERT pre-training model is used to highlight the role of key ICD coding and improve its matching performance. Finally, it is classified by a fully connected neural network classifier to realize the many-to-many mapping between clinical records and ICD codes. On the widely used MIMIC-III full data set and sample data set, the TRIC model is compared with 12 benchmark models. The best results of 0.586, 0.109, 0.989, 0.937 and 0.758 were obtained for MiF, MaF, MiAUC, MaAUC and P@8, respectively, which verified that the TRIC model can effectively improve the quality of ICD automatic coding.",

However, most current research focuses on single-modal images and does not fully leverage the comprehensive information from multimodal medical images, limiting model performance. To enhance screening accuracy, this study uses a deep learning framework that integrates high-dimensional convolutions of B-mode ultrasound (BMUS) and strain elastography (SE) images to predict the malignancy of TI-RADS 4 thyroid nodules with high-risk features. First, we extract nodule regions from the images and expand the boundary areas. Then, adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) algorithms are applied to enhance ultrasound image contrast. Finally, deep learning techniques are used to extract and fuse high-dimensional features from both ultrasound modalities to classify benign and malignant thyroid nodules.",

The objective of this study was to explore the effective components, potential targets and regulatory mechanisms of SXD in improving AHMI. This study innovatively employed the combined strategy including network pharmacology, transcriptomics, proteomics, molecular docking, and molecular biology to analyze the targets and mechanism pathways of SXD for improving AHMI. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/Q Exactive HFX mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QE-MS) and network pharmacology were adopted to identify active ingredients and analyze their functions. On this basis, transcriptomics and proteomics technologies were integrated to further investigate and validate the mechanisms at both gene and protein levels. Additionally, a herbs-components-targets-pathways (HCTP) network was generated for exploration and analysis. Molecular docking was utilized for an in-depth examination of the binding activity between screened components and targets. Finally, molecular biology techniques were applied to re-confirm the targets and mechanisms involved. SXD effectively reduced heart's abnormal electrical activity, inhibited the release of various myocardial enzymes, troponins and inflammatory factors into the blood. Network pharmacology, transcriptomics, proteomics revealed that inflammatory response was important for the effects of SXD in AHMI. The combined analysis of network pharmacology, transcriptomics, proteomics constructed the HCTP network encompassing 5 herbs, 13 active ingredients, 146 targets and 20 signaling pathways to elucidate the mechanism by which SXD exerts its effects on AHMI, further analysis suggested that SXD regulated IL-17, MAPK/ERK, and Ras signaling pathways to alleviate AHMI. The positive effect of SXD on AHMI was achieved through the regulation of inflammation-related pathways (IL-17, MAPK/ERK, and Ras signaling pathways), the inhibition of inflammatory factors releases and the modulation of the inflammatory response.",

The image quality of bpMRI was assessed by two radiologists in consensus using Prostate Imaging Quality Score version 2 (PI-QUAL v2). Technical parameters of T2WI and DWI were extracted, and their associations with imaging quality criteria were evaluated. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for detecting csPCa were compared according to PI-QUAL v2 scores. Among 112 men who underwent bpMRI at 69 different imaging facilities, 47 (42.0 %) MRIs were considered not applicable for PI-QUAL v2 scoring. Of the remaining MRIs, 30 (26.8 %), 17 (15.2 %), and and 18 (16.1 %) were assigned PI-QUAL v2 scores of 1, 2, and 3, respectively. MRIs with PI-QUAL v2 scores ≤ 1 demonstrated significantly lower sensitivity (74.3 %) than those with scores of 2 or 3 (100.0 %; P = 0.045). In-plane resolution on T2WI and the number of b values on DWI were significantly associated with image quality assessment (P = 0.037 and 0.028). The diagnostic accuracy of bpMRI for detecting csPCa is influenced by image quality, as assessed by the PI-QUAL v2 scoring system. Adequate in-plane resolution on T2WI and the use of at least three b values on DWI should be emphasised to achieve optimal image quality and diagnostic performance.",

The maximum active mobility of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and the distal interphalangeal joint in the donor area was 66.51±7.38°and 43.21±4.62°, respectively. Given its low donor-site morbidity and favorable cosmetic and functional outcomes, one-stage reconstruction of donor site defects using artificial dermis represents an effective and clinically viable treatment option.",

However, the operative management has gained an innovative technique. In the last decade, intramedullary (IM) nailing was introduced in local guidelines as a treatment for a selective group of elderly patients with compromised soft-tissues, as this technique is minimally invasive and less prone to wound complications including infections. Based on the authors' experience with IM nailing of the fibula using an intramedullary locking fibula nail, common technical challenges are highlighted and tips and tricks are provided to achieve optimal anatomic reduction by optimizing the entry point of the nail.",

The primary outcomes were the rates of disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) among patients treated with neoadjuvant IPC. Secondary outcomes focused on adverse effects and toxicity. Overall, 562 manuscripts were screened and 7 papers were included, totalling 158 patients. For cytology-positive patients, the addition of IPC led to a conversion to negative cytology and radical surgery in 78-89 %. This was associated with relatively high DFS and OS. Peritoneal-specific recurrence was higher in cohorts who initially had cytology-positive disease (63-69 %) compared to those who did not (0-29 %). Our data suggest that OS is lower in patients who were initially cytology-positive compared to cytology-negative disease. Importantly, neoadjuvant IPC did not appear to significantly increase treatment-related adverse events. Our results suggest that the neoadjuvant IPC has efficacy and is safe, with high rates of cytology conversion (in cytology-positive disease), low rates of peritoneal recurrence (in locally advanced disease). This was associated with substantial improvements in DFS and OS, compared to current standard treatment regimens.",

      "content": "Device failure is extremely common, and carries immense morbidity for patients, their families, and the healthcare system. Predicting shunt obstruction remains a substantial challenge. Clinically, cerebrospinal fluid protein (CSFp) is suspected to contribute to VPS obstruction, this is widely debated, and definitive evidence is lacking. We assess the relationship of CSFp in predicting VPS failure in children. A retrospective review of VPS procedures at the Queensland Children's Hospital between 2014-2019 was conducted. The relationship between CSFp level and outcome were explored. A conventional CSFp threshold above 500 mg/L is considered elevated, however a continuous relationship was assessed to better describe concentration associations. Outcome variables were early (<90-days) and late VPS obstruction (<1-year). A CNS infection was reason for exclusion. A logarithmic correction was applied to CSFp (Log-CSFp) for statistical modelling. 552 procedures were assessed in 243 patients. Fifty-eight (10.5 %) VP shunts obstructed within 90-days, 87 (15.8 %) within 1-year. 63 patients (25.9 %) experienced an episode of <1-year VPS obstruction. Multivariate analysis found Log-CSFp was predictive for early VPS obstruction (OR 1.40, 1.20-1.63, p < 0.0001), and late VPS obstruction (OR 1.37, 1.17-1.62, p < 0.0001) independent to hydrocephalus aetiology, patient age, and CSF red blood cell count. Older patient age was a significant protective factor for late VPS obstruction (OR 0.89, 0.82-0.96, p = 0.002). CSFp holds prognostic value for VPS obstruction in paediatric patients, a relentlessly unpredictable complication of VPS devices, informing procedure timing, patient follow-up and risk-stratification.",

      "content": "Nevertheless, conventional U-Net-based approaches usually suffer from the loss of critical structural details owing to repetitive down-sampling, while the encoder features often retain irrelevant information that is not properly utilized by the decoder. To solve these challenges, this paper offers a dual-attention U-shaped design, named ECASE-Unet, which seamlessly integrates Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks in both the encoder and decoder stages. By selectively recalibrating channel-wise information, the model increases diagnostically significant regions of interest and reduces noise. Furthermore, dilated convolutions are introduced at the bottleneck layer to capture multi-scale contextual cues without inflating computational complexity, and dropout regularization is systematically applied to prevent overfitting on heterogeneous data. Experimental results on the Kaggle Low-Grade-Glioma dataset suggest that ECASE-Unet greatly outperforms previous segmentation algorithms, reaching a Dice coefficient of 0.9197 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.8521. Comprehensive ablation studies further reveal that integrating ECA and SE modules delivers complementing benefits, supporting the model's robust efficacy in precisely identifying LGG boundaries. These findings underline the potential of ECASE-Unet to expedite clinical operations and improve patient outcomes. Future work will focus on improving the model's applicability to new MRI modalities and studying the integration of clinical characteristics for a more comprehensive characterization of brain tumors.",

      "content": "Agent-based models have proven to be useful tools in supporting decision-making processes in different application domains. The advent of modern computers and supercomputers has enabled these bottom-up approaches to realistically model human mobility and contact behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic showcased the urgent need for detailed and informative models that can answer research questions on transmission dynamics. We present a sophisticated agent-based model to simulate the spread of respiratory diseases. The model is highly modularized and can be used on various scales, from a small collection of buildings up to cities or countries. Although not being the focus of this paper, the model has undergone performance engineering on a single core and provides an efficient intra- and inter-simulation parallelization for time-critical decision-making processes. In order to allow answering research questions on individual level resolution, nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies such as face masks or venue closures can be implemented for particular locations or agents. In particular, we allow for sophisticated testing and isolation strategies to study the effects of minimal-invasive infectious disease mitigation. With realistic human mobility patterns for the region of Brunswick, Germany, we study the effects of different interventions between March 1st and May 30, 2021 in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our analyses suggest that symptom-independent testing has limited impact on the mitigation of disease dynamics if the dark figure in symptomatic cases is high.",

      "content": "Accompanying with the pathological process, the dense matrix caused stiffen microenvironment, which leads to poor chemotherapy. Therefore, understanding the potential mechanism of mechanical microenvironment on PDAC chemoresistance is of great significance. To this end, 3D printed methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) and hyaluronic acid methacryloyly (HAMA) hydrogel model was fabricated to resemble the mechanical microenvironment of PDAC. The results presented that the PDAC cell lines (MIA-PaCa2 and PANC-1) embedded in the hydrogel were distinctively less sensitive to gemcitabine compared to tissue culture plate (TCP) group. Interestingly, immunofluorescence staining and qRT-PCR assay demonstrated that the NRF2 level was elevated, which further upregulated the downstream effectors, such as SLC7A11 and GPX4. Meanwhile, the GSH concentration and GPX4 activity of hydrogel group were increased, while the lipid peroxidation level was reduced, which indicated that the matrix stiffness microenvironment mediated ferroptosis phenotype. Furthermore, RNA interference experiment elaborated that shNRF2 group showcased significantly enhanced sensitivity to gemcitabine, which demonstrated that the biomimetic microenvironment modulated chemoresistance through ferroptosis. All in all, the 3D printed model may serve as a new platform for illustrating the underlying mechanism of the TME induced chemoresistance, and also proposed a novel therapeutic strategy for PDAC through NRF2 inhibition, which effectively promotes ferroptosis to overcome chemoresistance.",

      "content": "Their lengthy vegetative growth period and the need for low temperature to induce flowering increase production costs. The blooming of plants is affected by numerous internal and external factors and is regulated by a sophisticated and intricate genetic network. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms governing floral transition in Phalaenopsis orchids have not yet been fully elucidated. This research identified 76 J-domain proteins from the Phalaenopsis genome, including two homologs related to flowering, referred to as PhJ3a and PhJ3b. Sequence and subcellular localization analyses revealed that the two PhJ3 proteins are typical DnaJ proteins localized in the nucleus. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to analyze the expression profiles of the two PhJ3 genes across different tissues and developmental stages during flowering. The maximum expression level of PhJ3a was observed in the shoot apical meristem, whereas the peak expression of PhJ3b was detected in the inflorescence meristem. Low-temperature and hormone treatments significantly affected the transcript levels of PhJ3a and PhJ3b. Overexpression of the two PhJ3 genes in Arabidopsis resulted in significantly earlier bolting in the transgenic plants than in the wild-type plants. Additionally, transient overexpression of PhJ3a and PhJ3b in Phalaenopsis promoted the expression of PhFT3 while inhibiting the expression of PhSVP. These discoveries will significantly improve our understanding of the essential role of J-domain proteins during the flowering period in orchids.",

Herein, the effects of different concentrations of SeNPs (0.00 mg/L, 0.02 mg/L and 0.05 mg/L) on the growth of cucumber roots were systematically evaluated via transcriptomics, metabolomics and physiological and biochemical measurement. Treatment with 0.02 mg/L and 0.05 mg/L SeNPs resulted in a reduction of taproot length by 21.49 % and 16.98 %, respectively, compared to the control group, while significantly enhancing the growth of lateral roots. The activities of CAT and APX in roots treated with 0.05 mg/L SeNPs were significantly enhanced compared to the control group. Integrated analyses of transcriptome and metabolome revealed significant changes in gene expression levels and metabolite profiles linked to plant hormone signal pathways. This includes IAA, GH3, SAUR, CRE1, AHP, A-ARR, PP2C, ERF1/2, BAK1, TCH4, TGA, and PR-1. The levels of abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid were also altered after SeNPs treatment. Moreover, many key genes and metabolites associated with linoleic acid metabolism, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were up-regulated. This includes LOX1_5, LOX2S, ALDO, L-cysteine, and glyceric acid. This study provides an important theoretical basis for understanding the mechanisms that underlie the effects of SeNPs in regulating cucumber root development.",

Historically, basements have been exclusively used as secondary spaces (e.g., storage), however, housing market pressures have driven homeowners to renovate and utilize their basements as primary living spaces. As such, this in silico study modeled potential exposures to radon, PM2.5, and mold spores in a basement of single-family residence for a variety of use cases using the CONTAM indoor air quality software. Significant differences in the potential exposures to all three pollutants were observed compared to the control scenario, with the most important factor impacting pollutant exposure being time spent in the basement. Additionally, to increase the accessibility in understanding one's own exposures, a relative exposure assessment tool was developed and applied to our scenarios to demonstrate an accessible way to help the broader audience understand indoor pollutant risks. While no real-world homes were sampled to validate this work, it still provides a foundation for the future of home assessment and highlights the potential impacts of pollutant exposures in often-overlooked residential spaces, allowing for future improvements to residential design and modification.",

Our study aimed to explore feasibility and safety of the LIFT wellbeing app. A 12-week single arm feasibility study was conducted with 59 AYAs aged 16-25 years recruited from New Zealand and the United States, and twenty-two support people (e.g. caregivers). Feasibility outcomes included retention, data completeness, user engagement and safety. Psychosocial and clinical outcomes (HbA1c and time-in-range) were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. Retention and completion of self-reported outcome measures was > 80 % for AYAs and support people. Users reported good engagement with the app. No adverse events occurred. Psychosocial outcome measures showed promising changes from baseline to 12-weeks. LIFT was deemed engaging, safe and feasible with promising preliminary changes in psychological outcomes.",

Calculations of activation energies showed that the addition of DNAN enhanced the sensitivity of HMX to thermal stimuli. In terms of products, the addition of DNAN significantly impacted the final product H<sub>2</sub>O of HMX, while its impact on CO<sub>2</sub> is relatively small.

However, for many seabirds breeding at high latitudes, both the extent and nature of contaminant exposure remain largely unknown. This study aimed to identify the persistent organic pollutants (POPs) present in the Svalbard Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica at the northern limit of its range. We also compare contaminant concentrations with those found in other species breeding on Svalbard and in puffin colonies further south. The Svalbard puffins were found to be contaminated by organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). No significant sex difference was found. OCPs, PCBs and/or PFASs concentrations in Svalbard puffins were comparable to those of Brünnich's guillemots Uria lomvia, black guillemots Cepphus grylle, and/or little auks Alle alle, but lower than in glaucous gulls Larus hyperboreus. PFAS concentrations were also lower than in black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla. OCP and PCB concentrations were lower on Svalbard than in puffin colonies further south. This study is the first to document PFAS concentrations in puffins, therefore it remains unknown whether PFAS levels were also lower on Svalbard than further south. These comparisons should be interpreted with caution, as data for different species or colonies were collected in different years, and contaminant levels vary over time.",

      "content": "This study evaluated the distribution and characteristics of MPs in surface waters of Narragansett Bay, RI, the largest estuary in New England, which exhibits a strong north-to-south human population gradient along its shoreline. We implemented seasonal and tidal surface water sampling across two years coupled with simulations of MP movement using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). We observed higher concentrations of MPs in the urbanized northern regions of Narragansett Bay (mean ± SD, 0.67 ± 0.6 particles m<sup>-3</sup>) compared to the less populated southern regions (0.21 ± 0.1 particles m<sup>-3</sup>), but with significant temporal variability influenced by seasonal freshwater inputs, wind, and tides. Similarities between ROMS output and field-collected data were evident when evaluating broad trends in MP movement while fine-scale accuracy was limited. Simulated counts of virtual ROMS MPs were moderately correlated to field-collected data in shorter model durations (Spearman's coefficient, 3 d, ρ = 0.64) with correlation strength decreasing with increasing model duration (7 d, ρ = 0.49; 14 d, ρ = 0.13). This study emphasizes the importance of spatially comprehensive and appropriately replicated sampling to characterize the dynamic nature of MPs in estuaries. Our results suggest that coastal pollution management strategies would benefit from adaptive monitoring programs that account for spatio-temporal fluctuations in MP concentrations and consider the drivers of MP movement unique to each estuary to mitigate inputs.",

      "content": "Model accuracy was assessed by the difference in distances between simulated and observed trajectories from Synthetic Aperture Radar. Sixteen simulations tested different wind drift angles (10°-45°), drift factors (0 %, 3 % and 6 %), and Stokes drift inclusion. A 6 % drift factor accelerated coastward transport, while angles >25° reduced discrepancies between simulated and observed slick trajectories. The best parameterization combined a 45° angle with a 6 % factor (distance errors: 23.49-21.16 km), correctly simulating the coastal impact region. Contrary to previous studies, Stokes drift slightly worsened model performance. This effect and the high distance errors were likely due to (1) inconsistencies in the wind direction data used in the model and actual conditions during the first 21 h, and (2) the influence of the high-velocity core of the Brazil Current (~0.8 m s<sup>-1</sup>) only on the simulated plume, intensifying the southwestward transport and deviating from the observed slicks. Additional high temporal and spatial resolutions simulations with artificial northeast winds reinforced this hypothesis, showing improved accuracy when including Stokes drift (6 km distance error). These findings contribute to the discussion on the parameterization for oil dispersion simulations in MEDSLIK-II at mid-latitudes (~22°S) in the South Atlantic Ocean. The study underscores the importance of using hourly, high-resolution oceanic data as model input and in situ wind measurements to enhance model validation.",

      "content": "Historically, global mental health has struggled between an evidence based biomedical model and a rights-based approach focusing on user perspectives. A particularly problematic global mental health challenge is the use of restraints in psychiatry, highly regulated but controversial and risky, often deemed incompatible with human rights. Despite calls for an absolute ban, inconsistent terms, definitions, and reporting requirements complicate an accurate understanding. Effective research reporting in light of human rights is crucial for knowledge dissemination and ethical integrity. This paper aims to provide reporting guidance for the neglected area of restraints in child inpatient psychiatric care, integrating scientific evidence and human rights to enhance mental health service quality. This study builds upon a previous literature review by Pértega and Holmberg (2023) on child restraints in psychiatric settings that found a lack of human rights considerations in scientific literature in four domains: study context, stakeholders, restraint phenomena, and regulations. Relevance for reporting on these items were consulted through a Delphi process involving international experts from law, psychiatry, and social sciences, providing a comparative perspective on legal and psychiatric practices to refine the guidelines. To ensure evidence-based mental health interventions align with human rights principles, this paper proposes reporting standards that integrate human rights into research on child psychiatric care restraints. The RIGHTCARE-PR guidelines consist of 14 items across four domains, enhancing the clarity and comprehensiveness of research reporting.",

      "content": "Osteocytes are key in bone remodeling, responding to mechanical stimuli. The piezoelectric bone matrix converts these stimuli into electrical signals, influencing remodeling. To delve deeper into this, we created an osteocyte model within a piezoelectric bone matrix, incorporating the lacuna-canalicular system and mechanosensors such as integrins, cytoskeleton, and primary cilia. Upon subjecting the bone matrix to triaxial dynamic displacement loads, we examined the electric potential and flow velocity distributions and analyzed the mechanical signals of six mechanosensors. The results show that the strain is greater when the bone matrix is piezoelectric than non-piezoelectric. The maximum average potential of the surface structure of the cell membrane is about 69.3 mV. Piezoelectricity significantly increases the fluid velocity and changes the trend. The cytoskeleton and integrins in cell process experience greater stress than in cell body. Microtubules experience greater stress than actin filaments. Among all integrins, those in contact with collagen hillocks experience the greatest stress. In individual integrin, the β subunit has higher stress than α subunit, and the stress of legs connected to cytoskeleton is higher than head contacted with fluid. Within the cytoplasm, the stress of integrin increases with a decrease of the surrounding cytoskeleton density.",

Utilizing a custom-made artificial talar prosthesis in conjunction with TAA (combined TAA) is anticipated to address these issues. However, few studies have investigated in vivo ankle joint kinematics after TAA with an artificial talar prosthesis, and there is a need to evaluate and compare this newer approach with conventional talar implants, which only replace the articular surface of the talus (standard TAA). This study aimed to compare postoperative ankle joint kinematics in vivo between standard TAA and combined TAA. Twenty-six orthopedic patients who underwent TAA participated in this study (standard TAA: 9; combined TAA: 17). Computed tomography (CT) of the ankle was performed in non-weight-bearing maximal dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. In vivo ankle joint kinematics during these movements were calculated using three-dimensional implant models created from CT images and registered with the iterative closest point algorithm. The transitional motion from dorsiflexion to plantarflexion and the implant position and posture at each ankle position were assessed. There was no significant difference in the transition angles from dorsiflexion to plantarflexion between the standard and combined TAA groups. After combined TAA, the ankle joints exhibited a posture of more inclined inversion and abduction, and the implant position and posture did not significantly impact the postoperative range of motion.",

The overall outcome was a composite of the three subcategories categorized as favorable, intermediate, and poor. Twelve neonates were included, of which five (42%) exhibited a favorable outcome, two (17%) an intermediate outcome with sequelae, and five (42%) a poor outcome. There was a strong correlation of aortic steal (%) with cerebral interventional complications (Spearman ρ = 0.78) and neurodevelopmental outcomes at age two years (Spearman ρ = 0.93). Occurrence of cerebral interventional complications showed a strong correlation with long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes (Spearman ρ = 0.89). Disease severity as indicated by aortic steal (%) is associated with cerebral interventional complications and two-year neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with vein of Galen malformation. Cerebral interventional complications are strongly associated with outcomes at age two years and may be a direct and mediating risk factor between aortic steal (%) and neurodevelopment outcomes.",

      "content": "Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and targeted biopsies (TPBx) have enhanced PCa detection, but their accuracy compared to systematic biopsies (SPBx) is under discussion. This study investigates GS/GG concordance between prostate biopsies (TPBx and SPBx) and radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens, evaluating rates and factors associated with GS/GG upgrading and downgrading. A retrospective analysis of 100 patients with PI-RADS score > 3 lesions who underwent SPBx, with or without TPBx, followed by RP for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) was performed. csPCa diagnosis was made by SPBx alone in 9/100 (9 %) cases, TPBx alone in 1/100 (1 %), and TPBx combined with SPBx in 90/100 (90 %). In the TPBx group, 76/90 (84.4 %) patients presented concordant GS/GG between biopsy and RP, while 14/90 (15.6 %) showed lower GS/GG at RP. In the SPBx group, 88/90 (97.8 %) presented concordant GS/GG, while 2/90 (2.2 %) showed higher GS at RP. Our study highlights potential downgrading risk associated with TPBx alone, particularly in patients with initial GS of 4 + 4/GG4. While this has minimal implications for high-risk PCa, it raises concerns about potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment in men eligible for active surveillance (AS) who may be downgraded from intermediate-risk to low-risk or favourable intermediate-risk categories. This underscores the importance of using both TPBx and SPBx for PCa diagnosis and risk assessment.",

Arsenic permeates the food chain, posing potential hazards to ecosystems and human health. Studies have shown that marine fish possess a unique ability to accumulate substantial levels of arsenobetaine (AsB). However, the mechanism underlying the elevated abundance of AsB in marine fish has not been definitively identified. This review examines the significant accumulation of AsB in marine fish, the influence of salinity on AsB concentrations in the aquatic environment, the migration of As through food chains, the biotransport patterns of As in marine fish, the transformation potential of various As forms into AsB, the genes responsible for AsB biosynthesis, and the prediction of AsB accumulation and transformation mechanism in marine fish via machine learning. It provides a comprehensive analysis of established and hypothesized synthetic pathways associated with AsB.",

T1-weighted images, resting-state fMRIs and amyloid-β SUVRs were obtained from 234 DoD-ADNI subjects with or without TBI and/or PTSD. The denoised BOLD signal from 382 rois was extracted with CONN and dynamic resting state analysis was used to identify 8 states including one corresponding to a hypersynchrony state (HSS). SuStaIn with gray matter volumes and amyloid-β SUVR as inputs was used to identify 2 subtypes with progressive gray matter loss. HSS dwell-time correlated positively with amyloid-β (Kendall tau = 0.125,p = 0.047) and tau Braak stage 5&6 SUVR (Kendall tau = 0.200,p = 0.035). TBI increased the likelihood to observe the HSS (81 % with vs. 18 % wo TBI p < 0.001) as did a diagnosis of PTSD (67.4 % with vs. 32.6 % wo PTSD, p = 0.003). The SuStaIn subtypes differed mostly by the timing of the amyloid-β build-up but not by atrophy pattern. Subtype 2 had higher amyloid-β loads and longer HSS dwell-times than subtype 1 that had higher CAPS scores than subtype 2. Gray matter atrophy did not influence HSS dwell-time. TBI and PTSD increased the likelihood to observe HSS. HSS dwell time was determined by AD pathology severity. The subtype characteristics indicate that PTSD drives gray matter loss in subtype 1 and AD pathology that in subtype 2. Severity of gray matter atrophy influenced neither HSS occurrence nor intensity.",

In 2019, anti-PD-L1 antibodies atezolizumab or durvalumab were introduced for the treatment of extensive-stage (ES) SCLC in combination with chemotherapy. Two randomized phase III studies (IMpower 133 and CASPIAN) demonstrated that addition of atezolizumab or durvalumab to platinum plus etoposide prolonged the overall survival in ES-SCLC patients. In addition, consolidation therapy with durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy was also shown to prolong the overall survival in patients with limited-stage SCLC. Tarlatamab is a bispecific antibody that targets DLL3 and CD3. It binds to both DLL3 on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells, causing T-cell-mediated lysis of cancer cells. A phase II study (DeLLphi-301) showed a 40 % response rate and median progression-free survival of 4.9 months following tarlatamab administration in previously treated SCLC patients, which led to approval of this drug in Japan for the treatment of SCLC at the end of 2024.",

Understanding how Temozolomide interacts with different lipids within the brain cell membrane at the atomic level can help elucidate its ability to permeate through cell membranes. In this study, we constructed a simplified brain plasma membrane model to explore the microscopic structure and dynamics of Temozolomide using all-atom microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Temozolomide is typically found in the solvent-aqueous fluid surrounding the brain membrane, but it can access the membrane interface regularly and eventually bind to lipids of the choline and cerebroside classes. To investigate the free energy barriers of Temozolomide related to its crossing of brain-like plasma membranes, we employed adaptive biasing force methods. These simulations revealed that the free energy barriers ranged between 28 and 50 kcal/mol at temperatures between 310 K and 323 K. Our findings suggest that Temozolomide cannot cross the membrane by pure diffusion at normal human body temperature, but that rising the temperature significantly increases the probability of barrier crossing. This is primarily due to the crucial role played by cholesterol and lipids of the cerebroside class.",

The specificity and selectivity of the deuterated probe [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-TRODAT-d<sub>4</sub> for DAT were assessed through comparative analyses of in vivo biodistribution, blocking experiments, and autoradiography. Biological distribution results revealed that the target-to-non-target ratio (striatum/cerebellum, ST/CB) for [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-TRODAT-d<sub>4</sub> surpassed that of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-TRODAT-1 at 120 min post-injection (3.95 ± 0.39 vs 3.05 ± 0.61, p < 0.05). In vivo metabolism investigations demonstrated that [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-TRODAT-d<sub>4</sub> exhibits enhanced in vivo stability in mice compared with [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-TRODAT-1. Ex vivo autoradiographic findings indicated that [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-TRODAT-d<sub>4</sub> selectively accumulated in the DAT-abundant striatum and its ST/CB ratio was higher than that of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-TRODAT-1 (4.11 ± 0.25 vs 3.27 ± 0.09, p < 0.01).

      "content": "These metabotropic Gq-coupled receptors induce intracellular calcium mobilization and are expressed in various cell types, particularly leukocytes. Their activation triggers proinflammatory responses, playing a critical role in the progression of inflammatory diseases, nociception, and cancer. However, the absence of selective antagonists limits their clinical application, encouraging the search for novel compounds. In this study, we investigated the antagonistic effects of dichloromethane-methanol (DCM-MeOH) and ethanolic (EtOH) extracts from the branches and leaves of Joannesia princeps Vell. Using calcium measurement techniques, we demonstrated that the extracts, particularly those from branches, inhibit calcium responses mediated by P2Y receptors, suggesting potential selectivity. Importantly, this inhibitory activity was not attributed to a quenching effect. Additionally, cell viability was evaluated after 1 and 24 h of extract treatment using the MTT assay, which confirmed that the extracts did not induce cell death. Furthermore, we examined the analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of J. princeps branch extract, which could be related to P2Y receptor activation. In formalin-induced nociception and paw edema models in Swiss mice, the EtOH branch extract significantly reduced pain-related behaviors and alleviated paw edema. These findings highlight the potential of J. princeps branch extract as a uridine-activated P2Y receptor antagonist, offering promising therapeutic applications for inflammation and pain management.",

      "content": "The mucosal immune system entails the immune cells located in the body's mucosal surfaces and their mediators. Its function is to balance immune responses to pathogens and tolerance to harmless antigens. Treatment of autoimmune diseases is complicated by adverse events caused by suppression of systemic immunity by immunosuppressive medication. Targeting the mucosal immune system specifically in treating autoimmune diseases could circumvent systemic immune suppression and thereby reduce infection risk. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of pharmaceutical targets in the mucosal immune system, as a starting point in the search for new treatments for extra-intestinal auto-immune diseases. Preclinical and clinical studies were included and categorized into eight target categories: 'immune cells', 'signal transduction', 'inflammatory mediators', 'antibodies', 'microbiome', 'tolerance and mucosal vaccination', 'intestinal barrier' and 'other'. Studies investigating the most promising targets, namely mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells) and tolerance induction by mucosal vaccination, are described in more detail. MAIT cells have been shown to play a role in the pathophysiology of various auto-immune diseases, particularly in multiple sclerosis (MS). Although the role of these cells has not yet been established fully, mouse studies show that the antagonism of MAIT cells has the potential to be used in the treatment of auto-immune diseases. Mucosal vaccination has demonstrable effects on the immune system, but treatment regimens and antigens must be improved to demonstrate clinical effects more extensively.",

The absorbance peak of SOD rises with a red shift following titration with DNA polyhedrons. Furthermore, the anti-parallel β-sheet structure of SOD has undergone a conformational change, as indicated by CD spectroscopic studies. The binding mechanism between the SOD and DNA polyhedrons was investigated using isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy. Out of all the investigated DNA polyhedral structures, the DNA tetrahedron has a higher affinity for SOD with least impact on its secondary conformation. Furthermore, it was noted that the activity of cellular CuZnSOD was enhanced in the presence of DNA tetrahedron. The ROS scavenging activity of SOD was enhanced in presence of DNA polyhedral nanostructures. The presence of DNA polyhedral nanostructures appears to decrease ROS production in cells, as indicated by lower absorbance values in the NBT assay. Collectively, these findings suggest that DNA polyhedrons bind to the CuZnSOD without affecting the functional behaviour of the protein.",

We hypothesize that the interfacial shear elasticity acts as a resistive force to droplet wetting, with the equilibrium wetted state more influenced by the interfacial shear rheology than the interfacial/surface tensions. An oil droplet of DecTol (4:6 v/v) containing asphaltenes is brought into contact with a CO<sub>2</sub> bubble in brine. The shear viscoelasticity of the oil-brine interface is varied by changing the asphaltenes concentration (150 and 15,000 mg/L) and aging time of the system (10 and 120 min). Wetting behaviors of the oil droplet on the CO<sub>2</sub> bubble are captured using high speed imaging. Considering the interfacial/surface tensions of the three phases, the equilibrium wetted state would be that of an oil droplet fully encapsulating a CO<sub>2</sub> bubble.",

The change in wetting behavior is a result of the shear elasticity of the asphaltene film at the oil-brine interface. As the asphaltene film fractures/yields, the oil droplet begins to wet the CO<sub>2</sub> bubble, causing the interfacial film to be stretched. With the asphaltene film resistive force acting opposite to the wetting force, complete encapsulation is prevented, and for the highest film elasticity, partial dewetting of the oil droplet on the CO<sub>2</sub> bubble is seen, indicating a stronger resistive force than the wetting force (Gibbs energy).",

Among 51 included patient, TP53 was most frequently altered (88 %), followed by PIK3CA (35 %) and CCNE1 (33 %). Separate analysis of carcinoma and sarcoma components revealed concordant gene variants but divergent copy number variations. Based on molecular classification, the majority of the cases 44 (84.6 %) had a TP53mutant profile. Additionally, 11 cases were HR deficient, and 7 samples (14 %) had high TMB (≥16). Key altered pathways were TP53, RTK/RAS, PI3K, and cell cycle pathways. Altogether, alterations that could serve as possible molecular targets for existing therapies were identified in 45 cases (88 %). No molecular variables was statistical significant in the survival analysis. Although, the TP53-mutant profile was the most common subtype, UCS remains molecularly heterogeneous, revealing potential targets for existing therapies and emphasizing the role of molecular profiling in guiding treatment in UCS. Our comparison of the carcinoma and sarcoma components confirms a monoclonal origin. Despite its molecular heterogeneity, these findings highlight potential targets for existing therapies and emphasize the role of molecular sequencing in guiding treatment in UCS.",

A 36-year-old woman presented with a thyroid nodule detected on physical examination that gradually enlarged during a 3-year follow-up period. The patient underwent a unilateral thyroidectomy after completing the relevant preoperative investigations. Postoperative pathological immunohistochemical staining was positive for cathepsin K, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MiTF), and smooth muscle actin (SMA). The patient was diagnosed with a perivascular epithelioid tumor. The patient's condition stabilized after a short-term follow-up. Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) of the thyroid gland are extremely rare, with only one case reported in the literature. There are no clear criteria for distinguishing benign and malignant PEComas of the thyroid gland. This case suggests that surgical resection is a good management option for this patient, and long-term follow-up is needed to observe the outcome. Surgical resection is safe and feasible for PEComas of the thyroid gland.",

The mean difference obtained between CPAP pressure and Hpred formula was 2.4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The CPAP pressure means during titration was 2.4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O higher than pressure obtained by a formula for pillow group and 2.3 for the nasal group. In most patients, formula underestimated the CPAP pressure obtained during titration for both nasal and pillow masks.

A thematic textual analysis was conducted following Van Manen's hermeneutic approach. Regarding the theme of the \"Good Death\", Walker and Avant Concept Analysis was also used as a reference. Families defined \"The Good Death\" as one in which no physical, emotional, or spiritual suffering was experienced; the privacy and dignity of the child and family were preserved; the family was actively involved in decision-making and end-of-life care; emotional and spiritual accompaniment was provided; and the opportunity to generate memories and legacies was available. Consequences of experiencing a \"Good Death\" were awareness of the loss, emotional adaptive management, and allocation of the meaning/sense of loss. The experience of the death of a child in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit must ensure a peaceful, dignified, and respectful death, accompanied and participated in by the family to achieve a \"Good Death\".

Moreover, the Shapley additivity interpretation and partial dependence plots provided valuable insights into the key factors influencing DBP formation, aligning with experimental findings. A web application, known as the ACAI platform, was deployed for the first time to predict DBP levels using an automated ML protocol. This user-friendly platform makes DBP prediction accessible to a wide range of users, including those without programming expertise.

      "content": "The results showed that offshore culture led to significant Cu and Fe enrichment in sediments beneath the cage, with Cu enrichment factor increasing by 58 % in August. Sediment beneath the cage showed elevated acid soluble Fe and Co, reducible Cu, and oxidizable Fe and Cd in August, while increased reducible Cu, Co and Cd, and oxidizable Cd in December. Minimal contents of reducible PHEs (Fe, Mn, Al, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Zn, Pb) were observed at cage site in August, indicating the occurrence of hypoxia and reduction dissolution. Three primary pollution sources were identified: (1) residue feed and feces (Cu, Cd), (2) anti-fouling paints (Cu), and (3) corrosion of steel cage frames (Fe). The spatial distributions of PHEs and their fractions revealed that the offshore cage's impact on sediment was largely confined within a 250 m radius. Hakanson ecological risk assessment indicated low risk from Cu but moderate to considerable risk from Cd. Of particular concern were the elevated labile Cu and Cd in August and labile Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Cd and Pb in December, suggesting increased bioavailability. This study provides critical baseline data and novel insights into PHE dynamics in offshore aquaculture systems, offering valuable insights for sustainable aquaculture management.",

The insert box contained a film holder designed to accommodate several radiochromic films. The holder consisted of four separate 2 mm-thick plates and a cover, allowing the positioning of one to five films. For consistency, three films were used per case, positioned at 0 and ± 2 mm. Quasi-volumetric data were generated from the measured Gafchromic film data at various positions using B-spline interpolation, producing additional data points at 0.5 mm intervals. Five spine SBRT cases were analyzed by comparing 2.5D and 2D gamma analyses using different criteria and dose thresholds. The 2.5D gamma analysis showed higher gamma pass rates compared to the 2D analysis, with an average gamma pass rate of 98.6 % for the 2.5D analysis and 87.4 % for the 2D analysis, using 3 %/1 mm gamma criteria with a 5 % dose threshold. This represented an 11.2 % point increase in the gamma pass rate. The 2.5D gamma analysis provided higher gamma pass rates than the 2D analysis for film measurements, providing increased confidence in the accuracy of the spine VMAT treatment plan.",

      "content": "Central nervous system TB (CNS-TB) is a clinical spectrum with entities such as tuberculous meningitis and tuberculomas. Emerging evidence suggests that Mtb may directly or indirectly affect the hippocampus, a critical memory, learning, and cognition structure. This review aims to summarize the current biological understanding of Mtb's impact on the hippocampus, elucidate its potential role in neurodegeneration, and introduce the concept of \"Hippocampal syndrome secondary to tuberculosis (HSST)\" as a novel chronic entity within the CNS-TB spectrum. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to analyze how Mtb gains access to the brain, its neurotropism, and the resulting neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative effects on the hippocampus. Data from clinical, histopathological, and experimental studies were evaluated to assess potential links between TB and cognitive impairment. Mtb can access the CNS through hematogenous dissemination, the \"Trojan Horse\" mechanism, or via the olfactory pathway, bypassing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Once in the brain, Mtb induces chronic neuroinflammation and disrupts hippocampal structure. Studies suggest that TB increases the risk of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, with evidence of Mtb-driven amyloid-beta accumulation and neuronal loss. Furthermore, specific Mtb strains exhibit neurotropism and produce virulence factors that facilitate CNS invasion. Understanding the interaction between TB and neurocognitive disorders is critical for improving post-TB care. Recognizing HSST as a chronic condition within the CNS-TB spectrum may support early diagnosis and targeted interventions to mitigate long-term neurological consequences.",

The UPB-SRB combination outperforms the individual use of UPB or SRB. When UPB neutralized the pH of simulated AMD from 2 to 5, the highest cost-effectiveness was observed: the solution's pH increased to 7.2, with removal efficiencies for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, Fe, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and Mn<sup>2+</sup> reaching 89.18 %, 95.59 %, 95.81 %, and 88.2 %, respectively. The reaction products of the UPB-SRB synergy included FeOOH, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, FeS, Fe, and MnS. UPB utilized ammonia generated from urea hydrolysis to improve the acidic environment, while its metabolic by-products, including amino acids, organic acids, alcohols, and vitamin B, provided carbon and nitrogen sources for SRB. In the treatment of real AMD, the synergistic effect of UPB-SRB achieved removal efficiencies of 96.89 % for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, 100 % for Fe, and 99.89 % for Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and raised the pH from 2 to 8. The treated AMD showed no bio-toxicity or potential risks and demonstrated agricultural reuse potential. By replacing traditional carbon/nitrogen sources with urea-containing wastewater, the combined use of UPB and SRB provides an efficient, safe, and cost-effective solution for AMD disposal, offering a novel approach to optimizing SRB-based AMD treatment and urea wastewater resource utilization.",

      "content": "It is also a critical raw material whose mining is expected to increase. Mine waste management aims to create an anoxic environment of neutral pH to limit sulfide oxidation and acid mine drainage. This study evaluates the stability of W-minerals under such geochemical conditions to develop recommendations for W mine waste management. Intact cores of legacy mine tailings from Morkulltjärnen, Sweden, were collected and analyzed using whole rock geochemistry and XRD. Monolayers with minutes amounts of W were generated by hydroseparation and studied using SEM-EDS, automated mineralogy, and microprobe analysis. Scheelite concentrates from the decommissioned processing plant were analyzed with XRF and 7 step sequential extractions. Groundwater was collected from eight wells in the Morkulltjärnen tailings in 2023 and 2024 and analyzed for 71 elements, anions and chemophysical parameters. This is one of the first field studies presenting mineralogical signs of scheelite weathering with tabular morphology, rod-shaped and porous structure, and loss of W from the crystal lattice, leading to very high concentrations (up to 23 mg/L) of dissolved W in anoxic and alkaline groundwater. This shows that standard mine waste management practices are unsuitable for scheelite, and action is needed to limit W mobilization into the surrounding environment from scheelite-rich tailings. Adsorption onto Fe-(hydr)oxides may be effective for controlling W mobilization from legacy mine waste, but in new mines, sulfides and tungstates should be separated in the processing plant and stored under anoxic and oxic conditions, respectively.",

      "content": "Previous studies have reported the degradation of parabens by numerous Gram-negative strains and activated sludge, with degradation processes often involving transesterification. However, the physiological significance of transesterification has received little attention. Here, a Gram-positive bacterium, Microbacterium sp. S1037 was isolated and characterized for its ability to degrade eight parabens and completely mineralize them through p-hydroxybenzoate and protocatechuate (β-ketoadipate pathway). Moreover, strain S1037 also possesses the ability of paraben-transesterification. Alcohols compete with water molecules for the active center of enzymes, accelerating the transesterification of parabens and inhibiting hydrolysis. Considering that the fate of the transesterification product is still hydrolysis, we speculated and proved that such a \"superfluous\" mechanism is a detoxification strategy, and could be used in the bioremediation of parabens in wastewater. Microbial transesterification of parabens has been reported worldwide, and we speculated that it might be a common detoxification choice in the evolution of microorganisms worldwide.",

One hundred seventy-seven youth ages 13-20 (n = 93 BD, n = 84 controls) were included. Reactive hyperemia index (RHI), a non-invasive measure of vascular endothelial function, was evaluated using pulse amplitude tonometry. Serum was assayed for C-reactive protein (CRP). We examined differences in CRP based on diagnosis and mood state, and subsequently assessed for the relationship between CRP and RHI in the overall sample and in CRP-by-diagnosis interaction analyses, controlling for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). CRP was significantly higher in the BD group (1.94 ± 3.99 mg/L) relative to the controls (0.76 ± 0.86 mg/L; U = 3044, p = 0.01), but this finding did not survive correction for age, sex, and BMI. CRP was not significantly associated with RHI in the overall sample (β = -0.07, p = 0.42), in CRP-by-diagnosis interaction analyses (β = 0.07, p = 0.73), or when controlling for current depression (β = 0.07, p = 0.73) or mania (β = 0.07, p = 0.69). Unexpectedly, this study found no relationship between CRP and peripheral endothelial function among youth with BD. This may suggest that processes other than inflammation underlie early vascular dysfunction in BD, particularly microvascular dysfunction.",
