       "  'title': 'Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus: connections in epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatments.',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'The prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) has been consistently increasing worldwide. Sharing powerful genetic and environmental features in their pathogenesis, obesity amplifies the impact of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors on DM. The ectopic expansion of adipose tissue and excessive accumulation of certain nutrients and metabolites sabotage the metabolic balance via insulin resistance, dysfunctional autophagy, and microbiome-gut-brain axis, further exacerbating the dysregulation of immunometabolism through low-grade systemic inflammation, leading to an accelerated loss of functional β-cells and gradual elevation of blood glucose. Given these intricate connections, most available treatments of obesity and type 2 DM (T2DM) have a mutual effect on each other. For example, anti-obesity drugs can be anti-diabetic to some extent, and some anti-diabetic medicines, in contrast, have been shown to increase body weight, such as insulin. Meanwhile, surgical procedures, especially bariatric surgery, are more effective for both obesity and T2DM. Besides guaranteeing the availability and accessibility of all the available diagnostic and therapeutic tools, more clinical and experimental investigations on the pathogenesis of these two diseases are warranted to improve the efficacy and safety of the available and newly developed treatments.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Numerous laboratory tests are used in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these assays varies substantially. An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for laboratory analysis in screening, diagnosis, or monitoring of diabetes. The overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations were evaluated. The draft consensus recommendations were evaluated by invited reviewers and presented for public comment. Suggestions were incorporated as deemed appropriate by the authors (see Acknowledgments). The guidelines were reviewed by the Evidence Based Laboratory Medicine Committee and the Board of Directors of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry and by the Professional Practice Committee of the American Diabetes Association. Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the blood. Glycemic control is monitored by the people with diabetes measuring their own blood glucose with meters and/or with continuous interstitial glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and also by laboratory analysis of HbA1c. The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring, genetic testing, and measurement of ketones, autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide are addressed. The guidelines provide specific recommendations based on published data or derived from expert consensus. Several analytes are found to have minimal clinical value at the present time, and measurement of them is not recommended.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nowadays, diabetes mellitus has emerged as a significant global public health concern with a remarkable increase in its prevalence. This review article focuses on the definition of diabetes mellitus and its classification into different types, including type 1 diabetes (idiopathic and fulminant), type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, hybrid forms, slowly evolving immune-mediated diabetes, ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, and other special types. Diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus are also discussed. The role of inflammation in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is explored, along with the mediators and potential anti-inflammatory treatments. Furthermore, the involvement of various organs in diabetes mellitus is highlighted, such as the role of adipose tissue and obesity, gut microbiota, and pancreatic β-cells. The manifestation of pancreatic Langerhans β-cell islet inflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired insulin production and secretion are addressed. Additionally, the impact of diabetes mellitus on liver cirrhosis, acute kidney injury, immune system complications, and other diabetic complications like retinopathy and neuropathy is examined. Therefore, further research is required to enhance diagnosis, prevent chronic complications, and identify potential therapeutic targets for the management of diabetes mellitus and its associated dysfunctions.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Management of diabetic ketoacidosis.',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute life-threatening emergency in patients with diabetes, it can result in serious morbidity and mortality. Management of DKA requires reversing metabolic derangements, correcting volume depletion, electrolyte imbalances and acidosis while concurrently treating the precipitating illness. There are still controversies regarding certain aspects of DKA management. Different society guidelines have inconsistencies in their recommendations, while some aspects of treatment are not precise enough or have not been thoroughly studied. These controversies may include issues such as optimal fluid resuscitation, rate and type of Insulin therapy, potassium and bicarbonate replacement. Many institutions follow common society guidelines, however, other institutions either develop their own protocols for internal use or do not routinely use any protocols, resulting in inconsistencies in treatment and increased risk of complications and suboptimal outcomes. The objectives of this article are to review knowledge gaps and controversies in the treatment of DKA and provide our perspective on these issues. Moreover, we believe that special patient factors and comorbidities should receive more careful attention and consideration. Factors like pregnancy, renal disease, congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, older age, use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and site of care all impact the treatment approach and require tailored management strategies. However, guidelines often lack sufficient recommendations regarding specific conditions and comorbidities, we aim to address unique circumstances and provide an approach to managing complex patients with specific conditions and co-morbidities. We also sought to examine changes and trends in the treatment of DKA, illuminate on aspects of latest research with a perspective towards future developments and modifications.',\n",

The age stratum with the highest prevalence was the group between 65 and 80 years old with 15.7% (95% CI 15.3-16.1). People with diabetes had a mean age of 70 years (SD 14), 52% were women, and the most frequently associated cardiovascular risk factors were: dyslipidaemia (88%), arterial hypertension (74%) and obesity (55%). In relation to metabolic control, 60% had at least one glycosylated hemoglobin measured in the last year, 70% of which were less than 7%. Almost 80% have LDL measured at least once in the last 2 years, 55% of them had an LDL value equal to or less than 100 mg/dl. The macrovascular complications present in order of frequency were: acute myocardial infarction (11%), cerebrovascular accident (8%) and peripheral vascular disease (4%); while the microvascular complications were found to be diabetic neuropathy (4%) and retinopathy (2%). 7% had diabetic foot, with less than 1% amputations. Diabetes represents a prevalent problem, even in elderly patients. This population continues to present a high cardiovascular risk, with little compliance with therapeutic goals.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The worldwide increase in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus has raised the demand for new therapeutic strategies targeting diabetic symptoms and its chronic complications. Among different treatment options for diabetes, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) therapy attract the most attention. The therapeutic effects of ADMSCs are based primarily on their paracrine release of immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and trophic factors. Animal models of diabetes as well as human clinical trials have shown that ADMSCs can effectively facilitate endogenous β cell regeneration, preserve residual β cell mass, reduce islet graft rejection, regulate the immune system, and ultimately improve insulin sensitivity or ameliorate insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Nevertheless, transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells is associated with certain risks; therefore recently much attention has been devoted to ADMSCs derivatives, such as exosomes or conditioned media, as therapeutic agents for the treatment of diabetes. Compared to ADMSCs, cell-free therapy has even better therapeutic potential. This narrative review summarizes recent outcomes and molecular mechanisms of ADMSCs action in the treatment for both type 1 DM and type 2 DM, as well as shows their feasibility, benefits, and current limitations.',\n",

The incidence of T2DM is increasing globally, and a growing body of evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis may contribute to the development of this disease. Gut microbiota-derived metabolites, including bile acids, lipopolysaccharide, trimethylamine-N-oxide, tryptophan and indole derivatives, and short-chain fatty acids, have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of T2DM, playing a key role in the host-microbe crosstalk. This review aims to summarize the molecular links between gut microbiota-derived metabolites and the pathogenesis of T2DM. Additionally, we review the potential therapy and treatments for T2DM using probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation and other methods to modulate gut microbiota and its metabolites. Clinical trials investigating the role of gut microbiota and its metabolites have been critically discussed. This review highlights that targeting the gut microbiota and its metabolites could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of T2DM.',\n",
